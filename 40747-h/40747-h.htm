<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Geography has within the past few years won a new place
among the sciences. It is no longer regarded as simply a description
of the earth's surface, but as the foundation of all historical
study. Only in the light of their physical setting can the
great characters, movements, and events of human history be
rightly understood and appreciated. Moreover, geography is
now defined as a description not only of the earth and of its influence
upon man's development, but also of the solar, atmospheric,
and geological forces which throughout millions of years
have given the earth its present form. Hence, in its deeper
meaning, geography is a description of the divine character
and purpose expressing itself through natural forces, in the
physical contour of the earth, in the animate world, and, above
all, in the life and activities of man. Biblical geography, therefore,
is the first and in many ways the most important chapter
in that divine revelation which was perfected through the Hebrew
race and recorded in the Bible. Thus interpreted it has
a profound religious meaning, for through the plains and mountains,
the rivers and seas, the climate and flora of the biblical
world the Almighty spoke to men as plainly and unmistakably
as he did through the voices of his inspired seers and sages.</p>

<p>No other commentary upon the literature of the Bible is so
practical and luminous as biblical geography. Throughout
their long history the Hebrews were keenly attentive to the voice
of the Eternal speaking to them through nature. Their writings
abound in references and figures taken from the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
scenes and peculiar life of Palestine. The grim encircling
desert, the strange water-courses, losing themselves at times in
their rocky beds, fertile Carmel and snow-clad Hermon, the resounding
sea and the storm-lashed waters of Galilee are but a
few of the many physical characteristics of Palestine that have
left their indelible marks upon the Jewish and Christian Scriptures.
The same is true of Israel's unique faith and institutions.
Biblical geography, therefore, is not a study by itself,
but the natural introduction to all other biblical studies.</p>

<p>In his <i>Historical Geography of the Holy Land</i> and in the two
volumes on <i>Jerusalem</i>, Principal George Adam Smith, of Aberdeen,
has given a brilliant and luminous sketch of the geographical
divisions and cities of Palestine, tracing their history from
the earliest times to the present. Every writer on Palestine owes
him a great debt. The keenness and accuracy of his observations,
are confirmed at every point by the traveller. At the present
time, the need of a more compact manual, to present first
the physical geography of the biblical lands and then to trace
in broad outlines the history of Israel and of early Christianity
in close conjunction with their geographical background, has
long been recognized. In the present work unimportant details
have been omitted that the vital facts may stand out clearly
and in their true significance. The aim has been to furnish
the information that every Bible teacher should possess in order
to do the most effective work, and the geographical data with
which every student of the Bible should be familiar, in order intelligently
to interpret and fully appreciate the ancient Scriptures.</p>

<p>This volume embodies the results of many delightful months
spent in the lands of the eastern Mediterranean, and especially
in Palestine, during the years 1892 and 1910. Owing to improved
conditions in the Turkish Empire it is now possible, with
the proper camp equipment, to travel safely through the remotest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
places east of the Jordan and to visit Petra, that most fascinating
of Eastern cities. By securing his equipment at Beirut
the traveller may cross northern Galilee and then, with comfort,
go southward in the early spring through ancient Bashan,
Gilead, Moab, and Edom. Thence, with great economy of time
and effort, he may return through central Palestine, making frequent
détours to points of interest. In this way he will find the
quaint, fascinating old Palestine that has escaped the invasions
of the railroads and western tourists, and he will bear away exact
and vivid impressions of the land as it really was and still is.</p>

<p>The difficulties and expense of Palestine travel, however, render
such a journey impossible for the majority of Bible students.
Fortunately, the marvellous development of that most valuable
aid to modern education, the stereoscope and the stereograph,
make it possible for every one at a comparatively small expense
to visit Palestine and to gain under expert guidance in many ways
a clearer and more exact knowledge of the background of biblical
history and literature than he would through months of
travel. Through the courtesy of my publishers and the co-operation
of the well-known firm of Underwood &amp; Underwood,
of New York and London, I have been able to realize an ideal
that I have long cherished, and to place at the disposal of the
readers of this volume one hundred and forty stereographs (or,
if preferred for class and lecture use, stereopticon slides) that
illustrate the most important events of biblical geography and
history. They have been selected from over five hundred views
taken especially for this purpose, and enable the student to gain,
as he alone can through the stereoscope, the distinct state of
consciousness of being in scores of historic places rarely visited
even by the most venturesome travellers. Numbers referring
to these stereographs (or stereopticon slides) have been inserted
in the body of the text. In Appendix II the titles corresponding
to each number are given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>The large debt that I owe to the valiant army of pioneers and
explorers who have penetrated every part of the biblical world and
given us the results of their observations and study is suggested
by the selected bibliography in Appendix I. I am under especial
obligations to the officers of the Palestine Exploration
Fund, who kindly placed their library and maps in London at
my service and have also permitted me to use in reduced form
their Photo-Relief Map of Palestine.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h3>THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
BIBLICAL WORLD</h3>


<p><b>Extent of the Biblical World.</b> In its widest bounds, the
biblical world included practically all the important centres of
early human civilization. Its western outpost was the Ph&oelig;nician
city of Tarshish in southern Spain (about 5° west longitude)
and its eastern outpost did not extend beyond the Caspian Sea
and Persian Gulf (about 55° east longitude). Its southern
horizon was bounded by the land of Ethiopia (about 5° south
latitude) and its northern by the Black Sea (about 45° north
altitude). Thus the Old and New Testament world extended
fully sixty degrees from east to west, but at the most not more
than fifty degrees from north to south. With the exception of
Arabia, all of these lands gather about the Mediterranean, for
although the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates ultimately
find their way into the Indian Ocean, the people living in these
fertile valleys ever looked toward the Mediterranean and for
the most part found their field for conquest and commerce in
the west rather than in the east and south.</p>

<p><b>Conditions Favorable to Early Civilizations.</b> The greater
part of this ancient world consisted of wastes of water, of burning
sands or of dry, rocky, pasture lands. Less than one-fifth
was arable soil, and yet the tillable strips along the river valleys
on the eastern and northern Mediterranean were extremely
fertile. Here in four of five favored centres were supplied in
varying measure the conditions requisite for a strong primitive
civilization: (1) a warm, but not enervating climate; (2) a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fertile and easily cultivated territory which enabled the inhabitants
to store up a surplus of the things necessary for life; (3) a
geographical unity that made possible a homogeneous and
closely knit political and social organization; (4) a pressure
from without which spurred the people on to constant activity
and effort; (5) an opportunity for expansion and for intercommunication
with other strong nations. The result was that
the lands about the eastern Mediterranean were the scenes of
the world's earliest culture and history. From these centres
emanated the great civic, political, intellectual, artistic, moral,
and religious ideas and ideals that still strongly influence the
life and faith of the nations that rule the world. The character
of each of these early civilizations was in turn largely shaped
by the natural environment amidst which it arose.</p>

<p><b>Egypt's Climate and Resources.</b> The land of the Nile was
peculiarly favorable for the development of an exceedingly
early civilization. Lying near the equator and between extended
areas of hot, dry desert, it possessed an almost perfect
climate. While warm, it was never excessively hot, thanks to
the fresh north winds which blew from the sea. The desert
kept the atmosphere dry and cloudless through at least eleven
months in the year. The narrow strip of alluvial soil which
constituted the real land of Egypt was practically inexhaustible.
The Nile, which rose during the hot summer months, furnished
abundant water for irrigation. At the same tune the necessity
for constant activity in order to develop the full resources of the
land was a valuable incentive to industry. Finally, the uniformity
of the Nile valley furnished an excellent basis for a
unified social and political organization.</p>

<p><b>Its Isolation and Limitations.</b> At first Egypt's isolation
favored, but in the end fatally impeded the development of its
civilization. On every side it was shut in, not only by miles of
rocky desert on the east and west, but also on the north and
south by almost impassable barriers. In the south the fertile
territory narrows to a mere ribbon, with no natural highways
by land, while several great cataracts cut off approach by water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
On the north the Nile broadens out into a great impassable
marsh with only two narrow gateways. One of these is the
main western arm of the Nile, which reaches the Mediterranean
near Alexandria; the other is the Wady Tumilat, which runs
from the Isthmus of Suez through the biblical land of Goshen
to the Nile valley. In early centuries these few narrow and uninviting
avenues of approach on the north and south were
easily guarded. The result was that the Egyptians, at a very
early date, attained a high stage of culture, but they lacked that
stimulus from without which is essential to the highest development.
Once or twice, as in the days of the Hyksos and Ethiopian
invasions, foreigners pressed into the land, and as a result
the centuries immediately following were the most glorious in
Egypt's history. In general, however, the civilization of the
Nile valley was deficient in depth and idealism. It was grossly
material; it developed too easily and the people were too contented.
Even on the artistic side the brilliant promise of the
earlier centuries failed of fruition. Moreover, the protecting
natural barriers proved constricting, so that there was little
opportunity for expansion. Hence Egypt's civilization was always
provincial and by 500 <small>B.C.</small> had ceased to develop. From
this time on the people of the Nile tamely submitted to the
succession of foreign conquerors who have ever since ruled over
this garden land of the eastern world.</p>

<p><b>Conditions in the Tigris-Euphrates Valley.</b> Physical
conditions in the Tigris-Euphrates valley were in many ways
similar to those along the Nile. A warm but invigorating
climate, fertile, alluvial soil, deposited by the great rivers and
renewed each year by the floods, and the protection of the desert
on the west favored the development of a virile civilization, as
early if not earlier than that of Egypt. Starting from the same
northern mountains, the two great rivers find their way to the
Persian Gulf by widely different courses. The Tigris flows
southeast in a comparatively direct course of eleven hundred
miles. Its name, "The Arrow," suggests the rapidity of its
descent. The Euphrates, on the contrary, makes a long detour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
westward toward the Mediterranean and then turns to
the southeast, where for the greater part of the last half of its
one thousand eight hundred miles it flows through the desert.
The lands lying between the lower waters of these great rivers
were by nature fitted to become the home of the earliest civilization.
At a very early period these level plains attracted the
nomadic tribes from the neighboring desert. Here they found
soil that was exceedingly fertile, but covered to a great extent by
the overflow of the great rivers. To be made productive it had
to be drained in the flood and irrigated in the dry season by an
extensive system of canals and reservoirs. Hence this region
furnished powerful incentives to develop an energetic, enterprising
civilization. The absence of natural barriers in the
level plains of Babylonia and the uniformity of its physical
contour meant that in time all the Tigris-Euphrates valley
would inevitably be brought under one rule.</p>

<p><b>Forces Developing Its Civilization.</b> Unlike Egypt, Babylonia
was constantly subject to those thrusts from without which
were essential to a great civilization. From the Arabian desert
came nomadic invaders and from the mountains to the east and
north and probably from northern Syria powerful, warlike
peoples who either spurred the river dwellers on to strenuous
activity in order to repel the hostile attacks or else as conquerors
infused new blood and energy into the older races. On
the other hand, the absence of constraining barriers gave ample
opportunity for natural growth and expansion. The great
rivers were the highways of commerce and conquest. The
necessity of defence also suggested the advantages of conquest.
The result was that at a very early period the armies of Babylonia
had penetrated the mountains to the east and north and
had carried their victorious rule as far as the shore of the
Mediterranean on the west. Traders followed the armies, bearing
the products of Babylonian art and in turn enriching the
home-land with those of other nations. It was thus that Babylonia
in time became not only the mistress of the ancient
world, but also one of the chief centres from which emanated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
political, legal, artistic, and religious ideas and institutions that
influenced all the peoples living about the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>Civilization of Arabia.</b> Very different was the site of the
third Semitic civilization. The eastern shores of the Red
Sea are rocky and barren. No important streams or harbors
are found along this cheerless coast. The eastern slope of the
range of mountains that runs parallel to the Red Sea is, however,
one of the garden lands of the East. The clouds, chilled
by the mountains, deposit their rains here, while mountain
streams make it possible by irrigation to transform this part
of Arabia into a rich agricultural land. Here from an early
period was found a high type of civilization. Climate, soil,
and the spur of foreign invasion fostered its development. Its
products were famous throughout the ancient world. But it
was in the highest degree isolated from the stream of the world's
progress. Its one means of communication with outside nations
was by the caravans which crossed the deserts. Hence a
certain halo of mystery always surrounded this distant civilization.
Like that of Egypt, it lacked opportunity for expansion and
communication and so failed to rise above a certain level or to
make any deep or significant impression upon the other Semitic
nations.</p>

<p><b>Physical Characteristics of Syria and Palestine.</b> In
marked contrast with Arabia was the strip of hill and mountain
country lying on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, known in
later tunes as Syria and Palestine. The dominant feature in this
part of the Semitic world was the southern spurs of the Taurus
mountains, which here run parallel with the coast in two ranges
known as the Lebanons and the Anti-Lebanons. A warm,
equable climate and fertile soil, especially in the broad valleys
between the mountains, furnish the first necessities for a strong
civilization. Frequent rain during the whiter and many perennial
springs and brooks supply throughout most of this region
the water needed for a prosperous, agricultural population.
The desert on the east and the mountains in the north were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
homes of active, migrating peoples whose ever-recurring attacks
gave the inhabitants of Syria and Palestine a constant
stimulus.</p>

<p><b>Its Central Position and Lack of Unity.</b> This region was
also the isthmus lying between the sea and the desert that
connected Asia with Africa, and the ancient empires of Egypt
and Babylonia. The great caravan routes led across it from
Arabia on the south and Babylonia on the east to Asia Minor
and thence by sea to the ports of the northern Mediterranean.
One fatal defect, however, prevented it from becoming the permanent
home of one strong, conquering people: it lacked
physical unity. Its two rivers, the Orontes and the Jordan,
were comparatively unimportant and flowed in opposite directions.
Mountain ranges running from north to south and
in the north one running from east to west divided the territory
into eight or ten distinct areas. Wide variations in climate,
flora, and fauna separated these different zones, making a uniform
civilization practically impossible. No region, except the
fertile valley between the Lebanons and Anti-Lebanons, possessed
sufficient natural advantages to rule the whole territory
immediately east of the Mediterranean. As a result Syria and
Palestine were only at rare and comparatively brief periods
completely dominated by native conquerors. The physical characteristics
of this territory also suggested from the first a mixed
civilization, combining those of the desert, of Babylonia, of
Egypt, and of the other lands lying along the Mediterranean.
The infusion of foreign elements largely explains the remarkable
culture and religious life that flourished within the narrow
bounds of Syria and Palestine. This land was at the same
time the strategic point that commanded the rest of the ancient
world and was destined to send forth influences that were to
extend to the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>

<p><b>Asia Minor.</b> Asia Minor, like Syria, is lacking in physical
unity. Its centre is a high, barren plateau. This is encircled
on the south, west, and east by fertile coast plains. These
coast plains, however, are broken up into independent areas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by lofty mountains. From the central plateau came the invaders,
who spurred on the coast dwellers to put forth their strongest
efforts. Communication by sea and along the great highways
that run across the land from east to west brought to these
maritime city states the culture of the East and the West.
Under these conditions there naturally sprang up an exotic civilization,
not unified, but gathered about different civic centres;
not independent, but a brilliant fusion of native elements with
Semitic and Hellenic culture.</p>

<p><b>Mycenæ.</b> To the northwest, along the Dardanelles, the
coastal plain broadens out into one of the most fertile regions
in the ancient world. Frequent rains and perennial mountain
streams water the gently rolling fields. Here, in a comparatively
small area, were supplied in rich measure the five conditions
essential to a strong, early civilization. Here was the
seat of that ancient Mycenæan state, whose art and institutions
for a brief period rivalled, and in many ways surpassed, those of
Babylon and Egypt.</p>

<p><b>Greece.</b> Of all the ancient centres of civilization Greece
was in many ways the most unpromising. Its soil was for the
greater part stony and unproductive. Less than one-third
could be profitably tilled. The plains were not large and the
mountain ranges dominated the land, dividing it into small,
distinct areas. There were no navigable rivers and few perennial
streams available for irrigation. Moreover, the streams
brought down silt into the valleys, transforming them into
malarious marshes. As a result, Greece is to-day and probably
always has been the most malarial country in Europe. Its
limited area gave no opportunity for a great and extensive
civilization. Its great assets were a regular climate, a purifying
north wind, and the protection of its insular position, which
insured its security in its earlier days. While the land of Greece
was insular it was also central and in close touch with the
civilizations of Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean, for
the islands of the Ægean Sea were like stepping-stones connecting
Greece with the ancient East. The sea was also a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
highway which led to the most distant lands. Finally, Greece
was in a position to feel the invigorating shock of foreign invasion
from the north and east. Its division into small areas
meant the development of petty city states, with constant rivalry
of arms as well as of wit and art. This keen rivalry and the
intense civic loyalty that it kindled were the chief forces in the
development of the civilization of ancient Hellas. Its physical
character favored the rapid rise of a noble culture, but one
which would fall with equal rapidity because of the lack of an
opportunity for local expansion. It meant inevitably a scattered
people and a widely dispersed civilization. The result was that
even in the period of its decline Greek culture permeated and
ruled the entire civilized world.</p>

<p><b>Italy.</b> Further to the west Italy juts out into the heart of the
Mediterranean. On the north the lofty Alps protect it from
cold winds and snows. On almost every side it is encircled by
the warm waters of the Mediterranean and its tributary bays.
Throughout most of this narrow peninsula run the high Apennines.
On the east they are so close to the coast that the
descent to the sea is steep, the rivers insignificant, and the harbors
few. On the western side, however, the slope is much
more gradual and the coastal plains are exceedingly fertile.
They are traversed by rivers fed by the melting snows. The
result is that this western coast, with its many good harbors,
and its abounding fertility, furnished from earliest times a favorable
home for strong and active peoples. Here grew, mingled
in great profusion, the fruits and grains of both the temperate
and tropical climes. At many points, with the aid of irrigation,
the soil yields four or more crops a year. Throughout most of
this garden land the climate is semi-tropical without being
enervating. The brilliant sunshine is tempered by the cool
breezes from the sea and mountains. It is pre-eminently a
land of contrasts. On one side is the blue sea, on the other the
snow-capped mountains. On this western slope the temperature
varies from that of the chill snows and storms on the
mountains to the warm, humid air of the river basins. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the beautiful clear lakes on the heights the descent is sudden
to the malarial marshes in the lowlands.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Rome.</b> This western slope is cut midway
from north to south by the Tiber, next to the Po the largest
river in Italy. To the east the Apennines rise to their greatest
height, insuring a heavy annual rainfall. The Tiber valley itself
was one of the earliest highways from east to west and was in
ancient times the natural division between the highly civilized
Etruscans on the north and the Latins and the Greek colonies
on the south. Here the varied life of ancient Italy met and
mingled and the result was a virile race and a strong, aggressive
civilization. Its centre was the Palatine hill, a low volcanic
mound beside the Tiber, fourteen miles from its mouth. The
uniformity of the Italian territory favored the union of its mixed
population under the leadership of Rome its central city.</p>

<p><b>Reason Why Rome Went Forth to Conquer.</b> Even more
important in the development of its culture were the attacks
from without to which it was constantly exposed. Even the
lofty Alps did not prove impassable barriers to the barbarian
hordes who were attracted by this fertile land. Ancient Italy,
encircled by the sea and plentifully provided with open harbors
on the east and south, was never free from the dread of foreign
attack. Not until Rome had conquered the powerful nations
living on even the most distant shores of the Mediterranean
could she feel secure in her central position. It was this constant
fear, as well as the influence of her commanding position,
that made Rome in time the mistress of the Mediterranean.
From the East she received a century or two later than Greece
all that the old civilizations could give, both of good and evil.
This inheritance she in turn gave to the western world toward
which she faced and to which she belonged. Thus Rome was
the great connecting link between the East and the West, between
the ancient and the modern world.</p>

<p><b>Résumé.</b> The biblical world was, both in extent and point
of time, identical with the ancient civilized world. The outlook
of the biblical writers was at first limited to the eastern Mediterranean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but was gradually broadened until it included practically
all the peoples living about the great inland sea. Similarly
the life and faith of the Hebrews, at first local, became in time
world-wide. Each of the ancient races followed the lines of development
marked out by their geographical environment. Two
civilizations&mdash;that of the Hebrews and that of the Greeks&mdash;lacking
a suitable background for local growth and expansion,
went forth to conquer and transform the life and thought and
faith of all the world.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
PALESTINE</h3>


<p><b>History of the Terms Palestine and Canaan.</b> The term
Palestine, originally applied to the home of Israel's foes, the
Philistines, was used by the Greeks as a designation of southern
Syria, exclusive of Ph&oelig;nicia. The Greek historian Herodotus
was the first to employ it in this extended sense. The Romans
used the same term in the form Palestina and through them the
term Palestine has become the prevailing name in the western
world of the land once occupied by the Israelites and their
immediate neighbors on the east and west. The history of the
older name Canaan (Lowland) is similar. In the Tell el-Amarna
Letters, written in the fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small>, Canaan is limited
to the coast plains; but as the Canaanites, the Lowlanders,
began to occupy the inland plains the use of the term was extended
until it became the designation of all the territory from
the Mediterranean to the Jordan and Dead Sea valley. It
does not appear, however, to have ever been applied to the
east-Jordan land.</p>

<p><b>Bounds of Palestine.</b> Palestine lies between the eastern
shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian desert. Its
northern boundary is the southern slope of Mount Hermon
and the River Litany, as it turns abruptly to flow westward into
the Mediterranean. Palestine begins where the Lebanons and
Anti-Lebanons break into a series of elevated plateaus. Its
southern boundary is the varying line drawn east from the
southeastern end of the Mediterranean a little south of the
Dead Sea at the point where the hills of Judah and the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Country descend to the desert. Palestine therefore lies between
33° 30' and 31° north latitude and 34° and 37° east longitude.
Its approximate width is about a hundred miles and its length
from north to south only about a hundred and fifty miles. It
is, therefore, about the size of the State of Vermont.</p>

<p><b>Geological History.</b> The geological history of Palestine
is somewhat complex, but exceedingly illuminating. The underlying
rock is granite. This is now almost completely concealed
by later layers of sandstone (which appears in Edom and the
east-Jordan), dolomitic and nummulitic limestone and marl.
During the earlier geological periods the land was entirely
covered by the waters of the sea. Probably at the close of the
Pliocene period came the great volcanic upheaval which gave to
Syria and Palestine their distinctive character. It left a huge
rift running from north to south throughout Syria. This rift
is represented to-day by the valley between the Lebanons and
its continuation, the valley of the Jordan and Dead Sea. Further
south it may be traced through the Wady Arabah and the
Gulf of Akaba. This vast depression is the deepest to be found
anywhere on the earth's surface. The same great volcanic upheaval
gave to the mountains along the western coast their decided
northern and southern trend and the peculiar cliff-like
structure which characterizes their descent to the western shore.
Through the centuries frequent and severe earthquakes have
been felt along the borders of this ancient rift, and they are
still the terror of the inhabitants, even as in the days of the
Hebrew prophets.</p>

<p><b>Alluvial and Sand Deposits.</b> Until a comparatively late
geological period the sea came to the foot of the mountains.
The coast rose gradually and has later been built up by the
process of erosion that has cut down the mountains, especially
on the western side, where the rainfall was heaviest. The plains
along the shore have thus been enriched by vast alluvial deposits.
Very different was the deposit of Nile sediment, which
was blown in from the sea by the western winds, leaving a wide
border of yellow sand along the coast of Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><b>General Divisions.</b> Palestine is sharply divided by nature
into four divisions or zones, which extend in parallel lines from
north to south.<sup><a href="#z1">(1)</a></sup><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Along the Great Sea lie the narrow coast
plains which broaden in the south into the plains of Sharon
and Philistia. The second zone is the central plateau, with
hills three to four thousand feet in height in the north, which
sink by stages to the large Plain of Esdraelon. South of this
great plain lie the fertile hills of Samaria which in turn merge
into the stern hills of Judah. These again descend into the
low, rocky, rolling hills of the South Country. The third zone
is the Jordan and Dead Sea valley which begins at the foot of
Mount Hermon and rapidly sinks, until at the Dead Sea it is
one thousand two hundred and ninety-two feet below the surface
of the ocean. The fourth zone includes the elevated
plateaus which extend east of the Jordan and Dead Sea out into
the rocky Arabian desert.</p>

<p><b>Variety in Physical Contour.</b> The first striking characteristic
of Palestine is the great variety in physical contour,
climate, flora, and fauna to be found within its narrow compass
of less than fifteen thousand square miles. Coast plains, inland
valleys, elevated plateaus, deep, hot gorges, and glimpses
of snow-clad mountains are all included within the closest
possible bounds. In a journey of from two to three days the
traveller from west to east passes from the equable, balmy
climate of the Mediterranean coast to the comparatively cold
highlands of the central plateau and then down into the moist,
tropical climate of the hot Jordan and Dead Sea valley. Thence
he mounts the highlands of Gilead or Moab, where the sun
beats down hot at noonday, while the temperature falls low at
night and deep snows cover the hilltops in winter. The hills
of the central plateaus, covered with the trees of the temperate
zone, overhang the palms and tropical fruit trees of the coast
plains and Jordan valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><b>Effects of this Variety.</b> The different zones touch each
other closely, and yet their wide differences in physical contour,
climate, flora and fauna constitute invisible but insuperable barriers
and produce fundamentally diverse types of life and civilization.
To-day, as in the past, inhabitants of cities, tent
dwellers, merchants, and peasants live in this narrow land within
a few miles, yet separated from each other by the widest possible
difference in culture and manner of life. The character of the
land made impossible a closely knit civilization. It could
never become the centre of a great world-power. It was rather
destined to be the abode of many small tribes or nations, with
widely differing institutions and degrees of culture. The great
variety of scenery, climate, and life, however, made Palestine an
epitome of all the world. It was pre-eminently fitted to be the
home of a people called to speak a vital message in universal
terms to all the races of the earth. Its striking contrasts and
its marvellous beauty and picturesqueness also arrested the
attention of primitive men and explain the prominence of
nature worship among the early inhabitants of Palestine and
the large place that its rocks, brooks, hills and meadows occupy
in Israel's literature.</p>

<p><b>Openness to the Arabian Desert.</b> The second marked
peculiarity of Palestine is its openness to the desert. As Principal
Smith has aptly said, Palestine "lay, so to speak, broadside
on to the desert." With its comparatively fertile fields, it
has proved a loadstone that for thousands of years has attracted
the wandering Arabian tribes. These came in, however, not
as a rule in great waves, but as families, or small tribes. Up
through the South Country they penetrated the hills of Judah.
There in time they learned to cultivate the vine, although they
still retained their flocks. East of Moab and Gilead the arable
land merges gradually into the rocky desert and the Arabs to-day,
as in the past, claim as their own all the land to the Jordan
and Dead Sea valley, except where the settled population successfully
contests their claim by arms. Palestine, therefore,
has always been powerfully influenced by the peculiar life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
centralized government and fierce rivalry between tribes and
petty peoples&mdash;these are but a few of the characteristics of
Palestine's history that are primarily due to its openness to
Arabia.</p>

<p><b>Absence of Navigable Rivers and Good Harbors.</b> Palestine,
on the other hand, is shut off from close commercial
contact with other peoples. No great waterway invited the
trader and warrior to go out and conquer the rest of the world.
Instead, in the early periods when men depended chiefly upon
communication by river or sea, Palestine shut in its inhabitants
and tended to develop an intensive rather than an extensive
civilization. Its one large river, the Jordan, flows, not into the
ocean, but into a low inland sea, whose only outlet is by evaporation.
The coast line of Palestine is also characterized by the
lack of a single good harbor. At Joppa, at the northwestern
end of Carmel, and at Tyre the otherwise straight shore line
curves slightly inland; but at each of these points there is no
natural protection from the severe western gales. The Ph&oelig;nicians,
shut in by the eastern mountains, dared the perils of the
deep; but to the early peoples of Palestine the Great Sea was,
on the whole, a barrier rather than an invitation to commerce
and conquest.</p>

<p><b>Incentives to Industry.</b> The physical characteristics of
Palestine were well fitted to develop active, industrious inhabitants.
The constant pressure on their borders by Arabs,
who could be held back only by a strong, organized civilization,
was a powerful spur. The natural division of the land among
independent and usually hostile races made eternal activity
and watchfulness the price that must be paid for life and freedom.
Popular tradition, based on a fact that pre-eminently impresses
every traveller in the land to-day, states that the fabled
Titan, who was sent to scatter stones over the face of the earth,
distributed them equally over Europe and Africa, but that
when he came to Asia and was passing through Syria, his bag
broke, depositing its contents on Palestine. Throughout most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of its territory the rich soil can be cultivated only as the stones
are gathered either in huge heaps or fences. The fertility
of the plains can be utilized only as the waters of the mountain
brooks are used for irrigation. It is, therefore, a land that bred
hardy men, strong of muscle, resourceful, alert, and, active in
mind and body.</p>

<p><b>Incentives to Faith and Moral Culture.</b> Another still
more significant characteristic of Palestine was the powerful
incentive which it gave to the development of the faith of its inhabitants.
The constant presence of Arab invaders powerfully
emphasized their dependence upon their God or gods. The
changing climate of Palestine deepened that sense of dependence.
No great river like the Nile or the Euphrates brought its unfailing
supply of water, and water was essential to life. The
waters came down from heaven, or else burst like a miracle from
the rocky earth. If the latter rains failed to fill the cisterns and
enrich the springs and rivers, drought, with all its train of
woes, was inevitable. Little wonder that the ancient Canaanites
revered nature deities, and that they, like the Greeks, worshipped
the spirits of the springs, and especially those from
which came their dashing rivers. Locusts, earthquakes, and
pestilence in the lowland frequently brought disaster. In
all of these mysterious calamities primitive peoples saw the
direct manifestation of the Deity. In the fourth chapter of
his prophecy, Amos clearly voiced this wide-spread popular
belief:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I also it was who withheld from you the rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sent rain upon one city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While upon another I did not let it rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ye did not return to me," is the oracle of Jehovah.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I smote you with blight and mildew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I laid waste your gardens and vineyards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your fig and your olive trees the young locust devoured;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet you did not return to me," is the oracle of Jehovah.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"I sent among you a pestilence by the way of Egypt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I slew your youths by the sword, taking captive your horses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ye did not return to me," is the oracle of Jehovah (Am. 4:7-10).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hence in a land like Palestine it was natural and almost inevitable
that men should eagerly seek to know the will of the Deity
and should strive to live in accord with it. It was a fitting school
in which to nurture the race that attained the deepest sense of
the divine presence, the most intense spirit of worship and devotion,
and the most exalted moral consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Central and Exposed to Attack on Every Side.</b> Palestine,
in common with the rest of Syria, held a central position in
relation to the other ancient civilizations. Through it ran the
great highways from Babylon and Assyria to Egypt. Along
its eastern border passed the great road from Damascus and
Mesopotamia to Arabia. It was the gateway and key to three
continents&mdash;Africa, Asia, and Europe. From each of these in
turn came conquerors&mdash;Egyptians and Ethiopians, Babylonians
and Assyrians, Greeks and Romans&mdash;against whom the divided
peoples of Palestine were practically helpless. Palestine, because
of its physical characteristics and central position was
destined to be ruled by rather than to rule over its powerful
neighbors. And yet this close contact with the powerful nations
of the earth inevitably enriched the civilization and faith of
the peoples living within this much contested land. It produced
the great political, social, and religious crises that called
forth the Hebrew prophets. It made the Israelites the transmuters
and transmitters of the rich heritage received from their
cultured neighbors and from their inspired teachers. In turn
it gave them their great opportunity, for repeated foreign conquests
and exile enabled them in time to go forth and conquer,
not with the sword of steel, but of divine truth, and to build
up an empire that knew no bounds of time or space.</p>

<p><b>Significance of Palestine's Characteristics.</b> Thus the
more important characteristics of Palestine are richly suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the unfolding of Israel's life and of the rôle that Judaism and
Christianity were destined to play in the world's history. Palestine
is the scene of the earlier stages of God's supreme revelation
of himself and his purpose to man and through man.
The more carefully that revelation is studied the clearer it appears
that the means whereby it was perfected were natural and
not contra-natural. The stony hills and valleys of Palestine,
the unique combination of sea and plain, of mountain and desert,
placed in the centre of the ancient world, were all silent but
effective agents in realizing God's eternal purpose in the life
of man.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>THE COAST PLAINS</h3>


<p><b>Extent and Character.</b> The eastern shore of the Mediterranean
is skirted by a series of low-lying coast plains, from one
to five miles wide in the north to twenty-five miles wide in the
south. At two points in Palestine the mountains come down
to the sea; the one is at the so-called Ladder of Tyre, about
fifteen miles south of the city from which it is named. Here
the precipitous cliffs break directly over the sea. The other
point is at Carmel, which, however, does not touch the sea directly,
but is bounded on its western end by a strip of plain
about two hundred yards wide. The soil of these coast plains
consists of alluvial deposits, largely clay and red quartz sand
washed down in the later geological periods from the mountains
of the central plateau and constantly renewed by the annual
freshets.</p>

<p><b>Fertility.</b> Because of the nature of the soil and their position,
these plains are among the most fertile spots in all Palestine.
Numerous brooks and rivers rush down from the eastern headlands.
Some of these are perennial; others furnish a supply
of water, which, if stored during the winter in reservoirs on the
heights above, is amply sufficient to irrigate the plains below.
The average temperature of these coast plains is sixty-eight
degrees. The cool sea-winds equalize the climate so that the
temperature changes little throughout the year and there is but
slight variation between the north and the south. Under these
favorable conditions the soil produces in rich abundance a great
variety of tropical fruits. Here grow side by side oranges,
lemons, apricots, figs, plums, bananas, grapes, olives, pomegranates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
almonds, citrons, and a great variety of vegetables,
as well as the cereals of the higher altitudes.</p>

<p><b>Divisions.</b> The coast plains of Palestine fall naturally into
four great divisions, broken by two mountain barriers. The
northern is the Plain of Tyre, which is the southern continuation
of the rich plains about Sidon. The second division is the
Plain of Acre, which lies directly south of the Ladder of Tyre
and extends to Carmel. The third is the Plain of Sharon,
which begins at the south of Carmel and merges opposite Joppa
into the ever widening Plain of Philistia.</p>

<p><b>Plain of Tyre.</b> Throughout the Plain of Tyre the low
foot-hills come down within a mile of the sea; but for five or
six miles back from the coast they must be reckoned as a part
of the same division, for their natural and political associations
are all with the coast rather than with the uplands. The city
of Tyre was originally built on an island <sup><a href="#z2">(2)</a></sup> and was supplied
with water from the Spring of Tyre, near the shore about five
miles to the south. The four great perennial rivers of Ph&oelig;nicia
were the Litany (the present Nahr el-Kasimiyeh, a few miles
north of Tyre), the Zaherâni, south of Sidon, the Nahr el-Auwali,
which was the ancient Bostrenus that watered the
plain to the north of Sidon, and the Nahr ed-Damur which was
the Tamyras of the ancients. Many springs in the plain and
on the hillsides contribute to the fertility of this land, which
was the home of the Ph&oelig;nicians. At the best the narrowness
of the territory, which supported only a very limited population,
made it necessary for this enterprising race to find an outlet
elsewhere. Long before the days of the Hebrews their colonies
had extended down the coast plains to Joppa and northward to
the Eleutherus (the present Nahr el-Kebir, north of Tripoli).
The nineteenth chapter of Judges refers to the Sidonian colony
at Laish (later the Hebrew Dan) at the foot of Mount Hermon;
but, with this exception, there is no evidence that they
ever attempted to plant colonies inland. Instead they found
their great outlet in the sea to the west. Launching their small
craft from the smooth sands that extend crescent-shaped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
north and to the south of their chief cities, Tyre and Sidon,
they skirted the Mediterranean, colonizing its islands and shores
until a line of Ph&oelig;nician settlements extended from one end
of the Great Sea to the other. Thus they were the first to open
that great door to the western world through which passed not
only the products of Semitic art and industry, but also in time
the immortal messages of Israel's inspired prophets, priests, and
sages, and of him who spoke as never man spoke before.</p>

<p><b>The Plain of Acre.</b> For ten miles to the south of the Plain
of Tyre the coast plain is almost completely cut off by the mountains,
which at Ras el-Abjad, the White Promontory of the
Roman writers, and at Ras en-Nakurah push out into the sea.
The great coast road runs along the cliffs high above the waters
in the rock-cut road made by Egyptian, Assyrian, and Roman
conquerors. The Plain of Acre, less than five miles wide in
the north, widens to ten miles in the south. Four perennial
streams water its fertile fields. On the west the sand from
the sea has swept in at places for a mile or more, blocking up
the streams in the south and transforming large areas into wet
morasses. In ancient times, however, most of the southern
part of the plain (like the northern end at present) was probably
in a high state of cultivation. Many large tells or ruined mounds
testify that it once supported a dense population. During most
of its history this plain was held by the Ph&oelig;nicians or their
Greek and Roman conquerors, but at certain times the Hebrews
appear to have here reached the sea.</p>

<p><b>Carmel.</b> The most striking object on the western side of
central Palestine is the bold elevated plateau of Carmel. Except
for the little strip of lowland on its seaward side, it completely
interrupts the succession of coast plains. Its formation
is the same as that of the central plateaus. Viewing Palestine
as a whole, it would seem that Carmel had slipped out of its
natural position, leaving the open Plain of Esdraelon and destroying
the otherwise regular symmetry of the land. Its long,
slightly waving sky-line, as it rises abruptly above the plains of
Acre and Esdraelon, commands the landscape for miles to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
north<sup><a href="#z3">(3)</a></sup> and adds greatly to the picturesqueness of Palestine.
It is about eighteen hundred feet in height and slopes gradually
downward to the southeast and northwest. The ascent on the
north is more abrupt than on the south, where it descends
slowly to the Plain of Sharon. As its name Carmel, The Garden,
suggests, it is by no means a barren, rocky mountain.
Instead, where the thickets and wild flowers have not taken
possession of the soil, it is still cultivated, as was most of its
broad surface in earlier times. The ruins of wine and olive
presses and of ancient villages testify to its rich productivity.
On its top the western showers first deposit their waters, so
that in the Old Testament Carmel is a synonym for superlative
fertility. Like the uplands of central Palestine, it was held
by the Hebrews, who from its heights gained their clearest view
of the Great Sea.</p>

<p><b>Plain of Sharon.</b> South of Carmel, beginning with an acute
angled triangle between the mountains and sea, rolls the undulating
Plain of Sharon. Opposite the southern end of Carmel it
is six or seven miles wide. Thence the plain broadens irregularly
until, at its southern end, opposite Joppa, it is twelve miles in
width. From north to south it is nearly fifty miles long. Groups
of hills from two to three hundred feet high dot this undulating
expanse of field and pasture. Five perennial streams flow across
it to the sea. Of these the most important are the Crocodile
River (the modern Nahr el-Zerka) a little north of Cæsarea,
and the Iskanderuneh in the south. Here again a wide fringe
of yellow sand bounds the sea and at several points holds back
the waters of the streams, making large marshes. In the north
there are a few groves of oaks, sole survivors of the great forest,
mentioned by Josephus and Strabo, which once covered the
Plain of Sharon. To-day the southern part of the plain is a
series of cultivated, fruitful fields and gardens,<sup><a href="#z4">(4)</a></sup> but the northern
end is covered in spring by a wealth of wild flowers, among
which are found anemones, brilliant red poppies, the narcissus,
which is probably the rose of Sharon, and the blue iris, which
may be the lily of the valley. Rich soil and abundant waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
are found on this plain; but its resources were never fully developed,
for it was the highway of the nations. Across it ran
the great coast road from Egypt to Ph&oelig;nicia in the north
and to Damascus and Babylonia in the northwest. Ph&oelig;nician,
Philistine, and Israelite held this plain in turn, but only in part
and temporarily, for having no natural defences, it was open to
all the world.</p>

<p><b>The Philistine Plain.</b> The only natural barrier that separates
the plains of Sharon and Philistia is the river which comes
down in two branches from the eastern hills, one branch leading
westward past the Beth-horons and the other through the Valley
of Ajalon. After much twisting and turning, and under many
local names, this, the largest river south of Carmel, finds the
sea a little north of Joppa. Southward the Plain of Philistia,
about forty miles in length, broadens until it is twenty miles
wide. The low hills of the Plain of Sharon change first into
long, rolling swells and then throughout much of the distance
settle into an almost absolutely level plain. In the southwest
the sands of the sea have come in many miles. Ashkelon now
lies between a sea of water and a sea of sand. At many other
points the yellow waves are steadily engulfing the cultivated
fields. Three perennial streams, with sprawling confluents,
cut their muddy course across this rich alluvial plain. It is one
of the important grain fields of Palestine, for the subsoil is constantly
saturated with the moisture which falls in abundance in
the winter and spring. No barns are necessary, for the grain
is thrashed and stored out under the rainless summer skies. It
is a land well fitted to support a rich and powerful agricultural
civilization. Like all the coast plains, it is wide open to the
trader and to the invader. Its possessors were obliged to be
ever ready and able to defend their homes from all foes. Its
inhabitants necessarily dwelt in a few strongly guarded cities.
Here in ancient times, especially on the eastern side, were found
the city-dwelling Canaanites. Later the valiant, energetic
Philistines established their title to these fruitful plains and
maintained it for centuries by sheer enterprise and force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
arms. The chief Philistine cities were Ekron and Ashdod in
the north, Askelon by the shore, quite close to the Judean foot-hills
and Gaza<sup><a href="#z5">(5)</a></sup> in the southwest. Except during the heroic
Maccabean age, the Israelites never succeeded and apparently
never seriously attempted to dispute this title. Lying on the
highway that ran straight on along the coast to Egypt, this part
of Palestine was most exposed to the powerful influences that
came from the land of the Nile. The oldest Egyptian inscriptions,
as well as the results of recent excavations, all reveal the
wide extent of this influence.</p>

<p><b>The Shephelah or Lowland.</b> Along the eastern side of the
Philistine plain, from the valley of Ajalon southward, runs a
series of low-lying foot-hills, which are separated from the central
plateau of Palestine by broad, shallow valleys running north
and south.<sup><a href="#z6">(6)</a></sup> This territory was called by the biblical writers,
the Shephelah or Lowland. These low chalk and limestone
hills, with their narrow glens, their numerous caves and broken
rocks, was the debatable ground between plain and hill country.
Sometimes it was held by the inhabitants of the plain, sometimes
by those of the hill country; always it was the battle-field between
the two. Even to-day it is sparsely inhabited, the haunt
of the Bedouin tribes, whose presence is clearest evidence of
the difficulties that the local government experiences in controlling
this wild border land. Like the Scottish lowlands, this
region is redolent with the memories of ancient border warfare.
It is also richly suggestive of one phase of that severe training
which through the long centuries produced a race with a mission
and a message to all the world.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>THE PLATEAU OF GALILEE AND THE PLAIN OF
ESDRAELON</h3>


<p><b>Physical and Political Significance of the Central Plateau.</b>
The backbone of Palestine is the great central plateau. It was
in this important zone that the drama of Israel's history was
chiefly enacted. Here was the true home of the Hebrews.
By virtue of its position this central zone naturally commanded
those to the east and west. For one brief period the Philistines
from the western coast plain nearly succeeded in conquering
and ruling all Palestine; but otherwise, until the world powers
outside began to invade the land, the centre of power lay among
the hills. This significant feature of Palestinian history is due
to two facts: (1) that in war the great advantage lies with the
people who hold the higher eminences and so can fight from
above; and (2) that the rugged uplands usually produce more
virile, energetic, liberty-loving people. At the same time it
may be noted that, while the centre of power lay among the
hills, the hill-dwellers never succeeded in conquering completely
or in holding permanently the zones to the east and west. So
firmly were the invisible bounds of each zone established that
the dwellers in one were never able wholly to overleap these
real though intangible lines and to weld together the diverse
types of civilization that sprang up in these different regions, so
near in point of distance, yet really so far removed from each*
other.</p>

<p><b>Natural and Political Bounds.</b> A part of the northern
plateau bore even in early Hebrew days the name of Galilee,
the Circle or the Region (I Kings, 9:11, II Kings, 15:29, Josh.
20:7). At first this region appears to have been confined to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
small area about Kedesh, where the Hebrew and older Gentile
population met and mingled. Gradually the name was extended,
until in the Maccabean and Roman period Galilee included
all of the central plateau north of the Plain of Esdraelon as far as
the Litany itself. Its western boundary lay where the central
plateau descends to the foot-hills and coast plains of Tyre and
Acre, and its eastern was the abrupt cliffs of the Jordan valley.
These were its natural boundaries; but Josephus, whose knowledge
of Galilee was peculiarly personal, includes in it the towns
about the Lake of Gennesaret (commonly designated in the
New Testament as the Sea of Galilee), the Plain of Esdraelon
and even Mount Carmel (<i>cf. Jewish Wars</i>, II, 3:4, 8:1, III, 3:1).</p>

<p><b>Its Extent and Natural Divisions.</b> Defined by its narrower
natural bounds, Galilee is about thirty miles wide from east to
west, and nearly fifty miles long from north to south. It comprises
an area, therefore, of a little less than fifteen hundred
square miles. It falls into two clearly marked divisions: (1)
Upper Galilee with its rolling elevated plateaus, bounded on
the east and west by hills which rise rapidly to the height of between
two thousand and four thousand feet; and (2) Lower
Galilee, lying to the south of an irregular line drawn westward
from the northern end of the Lake of Gennesaret to Acre on
the shore of the Mediterranean. This division line is marked by
the Wady Amud and the Wady et-Tuffah, which flow into the
northwestern end of the Lake of Gennesaret, and the series of
plains which cut from east to west through Galilee to a point
opposite Acre. This second division includes the lower hills,
which extend southward from the high plateaus of northern
Galilee, making an irregular terrace, never over nineteen hundred
feet high and gradually sloping to the Plain of Esdraelon,
which sends out several low valleys to meet and intersect the
descending hills. This clear-cut line of division was recognized
both by Josephus and the Talmudic writers.</p>

<p><b>Physical Characteristics of Upper Galilee.</b> The elevated
hills of upper Galilee constitute, therefore, the first terrace that
flanks the southern part of the Lebanons. The deep clefts between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the higher Lebanons and Anti-Lebanons to the north here
disappear. Even the Litany turns abruptly westward on the
northern border of Galilee, leaving a broad mass of rounded
limestone hills, greatly weathered by frost and rain. At a distance
this mass looks like a mountain range, but it consists in
reality of a high rolling plateau, cut by irregular valleys. This
plateau of upper Galilee reaches its highest elevation in a line
drawn northwest from Safed, which was probably "the city
set on a hill" of the Gospel record.<sup><a href="#z7">(7)</a></sup> The mountain on which
Safed stands is two thousand seven hundred and fifty feet above
the sea, while to the northwest Jebel Jermak, the highest mountain
of Galilee, rises to the height of three thousand nine hundred
and thirty-four feet. From this point many fertile upland valleys
radiate to the northwest, the north, the northeast, and the
east, but none to the south. Thus upper Galilee presents its
boldest front to the south, towering high above lower Galilee
and sloping to the north until it meets the mountains of the
southern Lebanons. On the southeast it slopes gradually down
to the Jordan and Lake Huleh, where two brooks come down
from the plain of Hazor. Farther north the hills rise very
abruptly from the Jordan and present a front unbroken by any
important streams. At many points on this eastern slope lava
streams have left their bold deposit of trap-rock. On the northwest
the descent to the coast plains is very gradual and regular,
but farther south the hills jut out abruptly to the sea. Upper
Galilee is an open region with splendid vistas of the blue coastline
of the Mediterranean on the west, of Carmel and the Samaria
hills on the south, of the lofty almost unbroken line of the plateau
of the Hauran and Gilead on the east; while the Lebanons
tower on the north, and above them all rises the massive peak of
Hermon, long into the springtime clad in cold, dazzling whiteness.
Galilee, as a whole, was a land well fitted to breed enthusiasts
and men of vision, intolerant alike of the inflexible
rule of Rome and of the constricting priestcraft of Jerusalem.
The Talmud states that the Galileans were ever more anxious
for honor than for money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><b>Its Fertility.</b> Upper Galilee was also a land of great fertility.
The one limitation was the profusion of rocks strewn especially
over the northern part. But if the Lebanons have
poured their stones over northern Galilee, they have compensated
with the wealth of waters which run through the valleys
and break out in springs or else are scattered in dashing
showers and deposited in heavy dews upon its rich soil. Where
wars and conquest have not denuded the land, trees grow to
the summits of the hills and grass and flowers flourish everywhere
in greatest profusion. It is a land of plenty, sunshine, beauty,
and contentment. Significant is the fact that it figures so little
in Israel's troubled history, for happy is the land that has no
history. Josephus's statement that in his day Galilee had a
population of nearly three millions is undoubtedly an exaggeration.
Even though, as in some parts of the land, to-day, the
villages almost touched each other and no part of the land lay
idle, Galilee could not have supported more than four or five
hundred thousand inhabitants (<i>cf.</i> Masterman, <i>Studies in Galilee</i>,
131-134).</p>

<p><b>Characteristics of Lower Galilee.</b> Lower Galilee possesses
the fertility of upper Galilee in even greater measure. With
a lower elevation and slightly warmer climate it bears a large
variety of trees and fruits. Its valleys are also broader and
lower and enriched with the soil washed down from the hills.
The broad, low plain of Asochis (the present Sahel el-Buttauf)
lies a little north of the heart of lower Galilee and from it valleys
radiate to the northeast, southwest, and southeast. Another
broad plain runs northeast from the Plain of Esdraelon to the
neighborhood of Nazareth and Mount Tabor, and east of
Tabor still another extends down to the Jordan River. The
rounded top of Mount Tabor commands a marvellous view of
lower Galilee. Across the fertile fields to the northeast lies the
Sea of Galilee, shut in by its steep banks, and beyond it the
mountain plateau of the Jaulan.<sup><a href="#z8">(8)</a></sup> Across the valley to the south
is the Hill of Moreh and the Samaritan hills beyond.<sup><a href="#z9">(9)</a></sup> Two
perennial brooks, the Wady Fejjas and the Wady el-Bireh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
flow down through southeastern Galilee into the Jordan. The result
is that lower Galilee is made up of a series of irregular hills
(of which the Nazareth group, a little south of the centre, is the
chief) separated by a network of broad, rich, intersecting plains.
It combines the vistas and large horizons of the north with the
fruitfulness of the plains. Here many different types of civilization
meet and mingle. Instead of being remote and provincial,
as is sometimes mistakenly supposed, lower Galilee is
close to the heart of Palestine and open to all the varied influences
which radiate from that little world. It is also intersected
by a network of little wadys running in every direction
from its open valleys and through its low-lying hills. Thus it
was bound closely not only to the rest of Palestine, but also to
the greater world that lay beyond.</p>

<p><b>Situation and Bounds of the Plain of Esdraelon.</b> The
Plain of Esdraelon is the last of the great terraces by which
the Lebanons descend on the south to the sea-level. The plain
itself lies only about two hundred feet above the level of the
Mediterranean and to the east sinks toward the Jordan to below
the sea-level. Its shape is that of an equiangular triangle. Its
base lies close under the northeast side of Mount Carmel and is
twenty miles long running from Tell el-Kasis to Jenîn. Its northern
line runs along the foot of the Nazareth hills for fifteen miles
to a point opposite Mount Tabor. The eastern boundary,
from Tabor to Jenîn is also about fifteen miles in length but
less regular. Moreh or Little Hermon and Mount Gilboa jut
out into the plain, which sends down toward the Jordan two
broad valleys, of which the most important is the plain of Jezreel
to the north of Gilboa.<sup><a href="#z10">(10)</a></sup> The watershed between these
two plains is near the modern village of Zerin which stood not
far from the ancient Jezreel.</p>

<p><b>Plain of Jezreel.</b> The Plain of Jezreel extends like a great
broad valley almost due east for about fifteen miles until it
reaches the Jordan. Through it runs the Nahr Jalûd with its
perennial parallel streams. Where the Plain of Jezreel joins
the low-lying Jordan valley stands the guardian of the gateway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the town of Beisan, which represents the ancient Bethshean,
later known as Scythopolis. This Plain of Jezreel, together
with the narrow valley through which the Kishon now finds its
way to the Mediterranean, completes the link between the
Great Sea and the Jordan Valley and for a brief space separates
the hills of Galilee from those of Samaria.</p>

<p><b>Water Supply and Fertility of the Plain of Esdraelon.</b>
Originally the Plain of Esdraelon appears to have been a shallow
inland lake. Viewed from the top of Mount Gilboa it appears
to be completely shut in by a circle of mountains on the north,
west, and south.<sup><a href="#z11">(11)</a></sup> Its elevation toward the east is so slight
and its outlets to the east and west so imperfect that during the
rainy season much of it is practically a morass. Into it drain
the waters from the surrounding hills. Some of the drainage
is on the surface, but most of it is underground, with the result
that at many points on the plain rushing springs pour forth their
waters, which run for a time as a dashing brook and then sink
again into the porous soil. Springs of this character are found
especially on the northeastern and southern sides of the plain.
Some of them ultimately send their scattered waters down the
Plain of Jezreel to the Jordan, but more of them find their outlet
through the low, muddy Kishon, which, with many turnings,
ploughs its way through the middle of the Plain of Esdraelon
to the shadow of Mount Carmel and then finds a narrow outlet
into the Mediterranean past the Galilean foot-hills, which here
are scarcely one hundred yards from the spurs of Mount Carmel.
As a result of its peculiar position and formation, the Plain of
Esdraelon is one of the best watered areas in all Palestine. In
certain places, indeed, it suffers from an excess of water. Its
loamy, basaltic soil is also richly fertile and its alluvial deposits
are free from stone. By nature it is fitted to be the great
grain field of central Palestine. The hills that jut out into
this garden land were naturally the first centres of a developed
agricultural civilization. Here on the southern border are found
the large mounds which were once the sites of teeming Canaanite
cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><b>Central and Commanding Position.</b> The Plain of Esdraelon,
like the Plain of Sharon, was a great highway of the
nations. Through the broad valleys which lead into it came
from every quarter the invaders, whether for peaceful or violent
conquest, for here all the important roads converged. On its
western border ran the great coast road from Egypt to Ph&oelig;nicia.
The eastern branches of the road also entered the plain from the
south through three different avenues. The one was through
the valley which led from the Plain of Sharon to the southeastern
end of Mount Carmel. Still more direct and easy was the approach
through northwestern Samaria along the Wady Arah,
past the famous old fortress of Megiddo. The third was farther
east along the broad Plain of Dothan to Engannim, the
present Jenîn, and thence along the eastern side of the Plain of
Esdraelon. These highways in turn connected with those which
ran past Mount Tabor to the populous cities on the Lake of
Gennesaret and thence to Damascus and the East. Another important
artery of trade ran along the wide, level Plain of Jezreel,
past Bethshean that guarded its eastern gateway<sup><a href="#z12">(12)</a></sup> to the
Jordan and thence northward to Damascus or directly eastward
to Gilead and the desert (<i>cf.</i> chap. IX).</p>

<p><b>Importance of the Plain in Palestinian History.</b> The
Plain of Esdraelon was both the door and the key to Palestine.
Through it came the ancient conquerors to possess the land. The
Midianites in the days of Gideon were but a part of that ever-advancing
Arab horde, which surged up through the Plain of
Jezreel whenever the government of central Palestine was weak.
On its gently sloping hills from the days of Thotmes III to Napoleon
were waged the great battles that determined the possession
of the land. Here, under the leadership of Deborah, the
Hebrews fought the valiant fight that left them masters of
Canaan and free to pass over the barrier of plain that had hitherto
kept apart the tribes of the north from those of the south.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<h3>THE HILLS OF SAMARIA AND JUDAH</h3>


<p><b>Character of the Hills of Samaria.</b> The hills of Samaria
and Judah are the southern extension of the central plateau of
Palestine, and yet, like Galilee and Esdraelon they constitute an
independent natural unit. No sharply defined boundary separates
them; rather the one gradually merges into the other. The
heights of Samaria and Judah are commonly called mountains
and the term is not entirely inappropriate when applied to the
range as a whole; but the individual peaks are in reality little
more than rounded hills. None of them rise over three thousand
four hundred feet above the sea-level. The highest rest upon
elevated plateaus, so that only two or three of them convey the
impression of towering height and majesty that is ordinarily
associated with the word mountain. Rather they are a chain
of hills which, viewed from the shore of the Mediterranean or
from the heights east of the Jordan, give the impression of a bold
mountain range. This is especially true as one looks up toward
them from the deep depression of the Jordan and Dead Sea
valley, for they completely fill the western horizon. The water=*shed
lies on the eastern side of the range. The result is that
the western hills have been worn down into gradually descending
terraces; while on the east the deep Jordan valley is exceedingly
abrupt, becoming more so in the south. At certain points the
descent is over twenty-eight hundred feet in nine miles, and down
by the western side of the Dead Sea there is often an almost
sheer fall of between fifteen hundred and three thousand feet.</p>

<p><b>Northeastern Samaria.</b> The hills of Samaria fall naturally
into two great divisions. The first extends from the plains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of Esdraelon and Jezreel to the one great valley which, following
the Wady el-Ifzim, cuts through Samaria from the northwest
to the southeast, running between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim.
The territory north of this line resembles lower Galilee
in many ways. On the east it consists of four ranges of hills,
divided by a series of broad valleys filled with rich basaltic soil
and plentifully supplied with water. These valleys and ranges
of hills, like Mount Carmel, have a general trend from northwest
to southeast. The northernmost is Mount Gilboa which
rises with a broad gradual slope on every side, to a height of
between one thousand two hundred and one thousand six
hundred and fifty feet. The bare limestone rock crops out at
many points, but villages and cultivated fields are found on its
broad top. Viewed from this point the hills of Samaria rise
gradually in great terraces.<sup><a href="#z13">(13)</a></sup> To the east and south of Gilboa
the wide plain about Bethshean cuts far into central Palestine.
Farther south the hills of Samaria, as bold rocky headlands,
jut far out into the Jordan valley. The next great valley south
of the Plain of Jezreel is that through which the Wady Farah<sup><a href="#z14">(14)</a></sup>
discharges its plenteous waters into the Jordan. This stream
and the Nahr Jalud are the chief western confluents of the
lower Jordan.</p>

<p><b>Northwestern Samaria.</b> In the northwest the hills of Samaria
descend gradually and are intersected by wide valleys
which open into the Plain of Sharon on the west and Esdraelon
on the north. None of its hills are over twenty-five
hundred feet in height. Verdure and often trees crown their
summits, while in the valleys are the rich fields of grain or olive
orchards, watered by springs and rivulets. The chief of these
valleys is the Plain of Dothan,<sup><a href="#z15">(15)</a></sup> which is connected by low
passes with the Plain of Sharon on the west and the Plain of
Esdraelon on the north. Farther south are the moist upland
meadows known to-day as the "Meadow of Sinking in." These
in turn are connected by an easy pass with the network of plains
that run southward past Ebal and Gerizim and on the southwest
to the city of Samaria and the Wady esh-Shair.<sup><a href="#z16">(16)</a></sup></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><b>The View from Mount Ebal.</b> The one real mountain of
northern Samaria is Ebal, which rises to the height of three
thousand and seventy-seven feet. It is a broad rounded mass of
limestone rock running from east to west parallel to Gerizim,
its companion on the south. Its sides, almost to the top, are
covered with gardens and olive orchards, enclosed by picturesque
cactus hedges. It commands the most comprehensive view of
any point in Palestine. Immediately to the south is the broad
cultivated back of Mount Gerizim, which lies only a few feet
lower than Ebal, while down in the narrow valley between the
two mountains is Nablus, the ancient Shechem. In the more distant
horizon is the ascending mass of the southern Samaritan
and Judean hills.<sup><a href="#z17">(17)</a></sup> On the east the Gilead hills present a lofty,
bold sky-line. Nearer but concealed by the rapidly descending
cliffs, is the deep valley of the Jordan; while in the foreground
following the sky-line to the northeast lies the level plateau of the
Hauran, which extends to the east of the Sea of Galilee, and beyond,
if the air is clear, the broad peak of Mount Hermon towers,
seventy-five miles away. In the immediate foreground<sup><a href="#z18">(18)</a></sup>
to the north is the network of open valleys of northern Samaria
intersected by the ridges of hills which sweep down from the
northwest toward the Jordan. Beyond is the depression where
lies the Plain of Esdraelon, while still farther to the north rise
in regular terraces lower and upper Galilee. The broad low
line of highlands in the northwest is Carmel running out to the
sea. In the west the irregular Samaritan hills, with their many
intersecting valleys, descend leisurely to the coast plains. Beyond,
only about twenty-five miles away, is the blue Mediterranean
with its fringe of yellow sands.</p>

<p><b>Bounds and General Characteristics of Southern Samaria.</b>
Southern Samaria, which lies to the south and west
of Mount Ebal, extends as far as the Wady Kelt and its northern
confluent, the Wady es-Suweinit, which comes up from ancient
Jericho to the vicinity of Michmash and Geba. On the southwest
it reaches to the Wady Malakeh, which, a little north of
the pass of Beth-horon, under the name Wady 'Ain 'Arîk, penetrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
nearly to the top of the watershed. In many ways southern
Samaria resembles northern Galilee. It is an elevated
plateau rising gradually from the western coast plains and culminating
in the southeast. Baal-Hazor, five miles north of
the pass of Michmash, rising to the height of three thousand, three
hundred and eighteen feet, is the highest point in Samaria, and
lacks only a few feet of being the highest point south of the
Plain of Esdraelon.</p>

<p>The descent in the east to the Jordan valley is exceedingly
steep and rocky. Two or three rushing brooks have cut deep
channels through the barren limestone rocks, which are covered
with only a scanty herbage. Northwest of Jericho rises, as a
terrace leading up to the heights above, the semi-detached mass
of barren rock known as the Quarantana (Jebel Kuruntul), and
still higher up to the west lies the wilderness of Bethaven, and
beyond the rocky hills of Mount Ephraim.<sup><a href="#z19">(19)</a></sup> On the high
central plateau north of Baal-Hazor are a network of small but
open plains, which run up past Shiloh to the east of Mount
Gerizim. These are fringed by rocky hills, but are themselves
exceedingly well-watered and fruitful and are covered to-day
with waving grain fields.</p>

<p><b>Southwestern Samaria.</b> The western part of southern
Samaria is the land of deep but open valleys. Trees and grass,
with many well-tilled fields, cover the hills and valleys. Chief
of these valleys which lead up from the plain are the Wady
esh-Shair (the Barley Vale), west of Shechem,<sup><a href="#z16">(16)</a></sup> the Brook
Kanah, the Wady Jib, which first flows south and then westward
into the Wady Deir Ballut, and the Wady ez-Zerka,
which, like the Wady Malakeh, finds its outlet into the sea
a little north of Jaffa. Prosperous villages, some capping the
summits of rounded hills, and others far down in sheltered spots
in the deep valleys, are scattered throughout this entire region.
The site of each was evidently chosen with a view to defence
against the many foes that, from earliest times, have passed up
through the valleys which stand wide open to the west. Like
the rest of Samaria, it was a land where peace could be secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
only by the sword and by strong battlements. It was also a
land where nature gave rich gifts to those who were strong
enough to maintain themselves against all invaders.</p>

<p><b>The Central Heights of Judah.</b> The central plateau of
southern Palestine culminates in Judea. It is a mass of rounded
hills averaging only about fifteen miles wide and not more than
forty miles long. Here erosion has worn away all bold, imposing
peaks. The highest points, Mizpah,<sup><a href="#z20">(20)</a></sup> the modern Neby
Samwil (two thousand, eight hundred and thirty-five feet high),
in the north and the heights immediately north of Hebron (three
thousand, three hundred and seventy feet), where the southern
plateau reaches its maximum elevation, are but rounded hills on
the top of a great plateau. Between these are narrow, rocky
valleys, dry during most of the year and strewn with stones
laid bare by the winter freshets. The landscape lacks distinctive
character. The prevailing impression is that of gray
and yellow limestone;<sup><a href="#z21">21</a></sup> and yet these fields of Judah are not
altogether unproductive, as is amply demonstrated by the
verdant fields in the vicinity of Jerusalem, Bethlehem,<sup><a href="#z22">(22)</a></sup> and
Hebron. Occasionally the native soil has been retained in a little
upland plain,<sup><a href="#z23">(23)</a></sup> as that east of Bethlehem or at Maon and
Carmel, south of Hebron, or in certain favored valleys, such as
Hinnom, to the south of Jerusalem. The soil, which is held
upon the hillsides by the terraces or piles of stone, is exceedingly
fruitful and supports patches of grain, or luxurious vines, or
verdant olive trees, which stand out in striking contrast to the
grim, rocky background.</p>

<p><b>Lack of Water Supply.</b> Even greater than the lack of soil
is the lack of water in Judah. Not a single perennial stream
is found within its immediate boundaries. Ezekiel's vision of
the broad stream running from the temple and irrigating the
entire land clearly indicates what he recognized to be its great
need. Throughout the entire land not a dozen copious springs
burst from the dry rock. Jerusalem and Hebron are thus blest
and, as a result, are still the chief cities of the land. Southwest
of Bethlehem are the so-called Pools of Solomon, the plenteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
waters of which are treasured in huge, ancient, rock-cut
reservoirs, from which, in Roman times, they were conducted
by high and low level aqueducts to Jerusalem. No snow-clad
Lebanons tower above the parched hills of Judah to supply
the much needed waters. To-day the rains of winter rush down
the rocky hills and valleys, where there is little soil and vegetation
to absorb and retain the moisture, leaving the land more denuded
than before. Undoubtedly, when the hills of Judah were properly
cultivated, as the presence of ruined terraces and watch-towers
even in the most deserted places indicate they once were, the
aspect of the landscape was very different; and yet, compared with
other parts of Palestine, it was ever barren. Its inhabitants
have always had to struggle for soil and water. In the past, as
at present, the chief water supply was from the rocky cisterns.
These were cut on the inside in the shape of a huge Oriental
water-jug and placed in a depression in the rock so that they
would be filled by the wash from the winter rains, which are
usually very copious throughout Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Wilderness of Judea.</b> The eastern slope of the southern
plateaus of Palestine is rightly called a wilderness. Like the
Shephelah or lowland on the west it is a distinct physical division
of the west-Jordan land. The cultivated fields extend only
four or five miles east of the central watershed. Near Jerusalem
the barren wilderness comes up and touches the fertile
fields about Bethany.<sup><a href="#z24">(24)</a></sup> The descent on this eastern side of
Judea to the low-lying Dead Sea is so precipitous that the water
from the winter rains runs off rapidly and has cut deep channels
through the soft clay and limestone cliffs so that irrigation is
impossible.<sup><a href="#z25">(25)</a></sup> No important villages are found in this desolate
region except at Engedi, where a beautiful spring bursts
out of the cliffs overhanging the Dead Sea and transforms the
barren desert into what seems by contrast a little paradise of
trees and gardens. Otherwise it is a land of dry, rocky, rounded
hills which descend in a series of three great terraces to the
depths below. Some vegetation is found between the rocks on
the higher uplands. It is the land of the shepherd and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Arab invaders<sup><a href="#z26">(26)</a></sup> who here press in from the desert and contend,
as they have for thousands of years, with the shepherds of
the outlying villages for the possession of the barren land. The
dominant features in the landscape are the rocky, rounded
bluffs, the great gorge of the Dead Sea, usually enveloped in
mists, and the dim outlines of the massive Moabite hills beyond.
This wilderness of Judea exercised two powerful influences
upon the life and thought of the people of the south:
(1) it brought to their doors the atmosphere and peculiar customs
and beliefs of the desert; and (2) it kept before them the might
and destructive power of Jehovah, as exemplified by the Dead
Sea and by the grim traditions that were associated with this
remarkable natural phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>Western Judah.</b> In contrast to the barren wilderness of
eastern Judah, the western hills slope gradually down to the
Philistine plain. The chief characteristic of this western slope
is the series of valleys which lead up from the lowlands, piercing
almost to the watershed in the great central plateau of Judah.
Most of these valleys are broad and fertile as they enter the hills,
but become ever more tortuous and wild as they ascend the
rocky heights. In the rainy season (December to February)
they are frequently swept by rushing torrents, which, undeterred
by soil or vegetation, soon run their course, leaving the stream,
during the greater part of the year, dry and rocky. At many
points the ascent is abrupt, between steep rocks, clad with low
bushes and wild flowers. In some places the path is so narrow
that it is impossible for a horse to turn with comfort.</p>

<p><b>Valley of Ajalon.</b> Six important valleys thus lead up from
the plain to the central highlands. The northernmost, and in
many ways the most important, is the Valley of Ajalon. It
marks the northwestern boundary of Judah. It is a great, broad,
fertile plain, lying between five hundred and a thousand feet
above sea-level. The stream which ultimately finds its way into
the sea a little north of Joppa, here makes a broad curve to the
northeast, receiving four or five small tributary streams from the
highlands of Judah and southern Samaria. From this valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
several roads lead up to the plateau north of Jerusalem. Of
these the most important is the one that ascends the pass of the
Upper and Lower Beth-horons, along which ran the most direct
and, in early times, the main highway from Jerusalem to
Joppa.<sup><a href="#z118">(118)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Wady Ali.</b> A little south of the Valley of Ajalon is the
narrow Wady Ali, along which runs to-day the carriage road from
Jerusalem to Joppa. Apparently because of the deepness and
narrowness of this valley it does not figure in biblical history
until the Maccabean period.</p>

<p><b>Valley of Sorek.</b> The third important gateway to Judah
was the Valley of Sorek, the present Wady es-Surar. Here the
modern railway from Joppa to Jerusalem penetrates the central
plateau. Just before the Valley of Sorek reaches the steep
ascent to the highlands it receives two important confluents,
the Wady el-Ghurab, from the northwest, and the Wady en-Nagil
from the south. Here the valley opens into a broad fertile
plain, closely connected with the larger Plain of Philistia and
yet encircled by the hills of the Shephelah. Immediately to the
north was the home of the Danites and about this picturesque
point gather the Samson stories. Along a winding and steep
ascent the narrow pass thence runs directly eastward toward
Jerusalem, approaching the city across the Valley of Rephaim
from the southwest.</p>

<p><b>Valley of Elah.</b> The fourth valley is that of Elah, the
Valley of the Terebinth, which is known to-day as the Wady
es-Sunt. This valley abounds in memories of David's earlier
exploits.<sup><a href="#z88">(88)</a></sup> Its eastern branch, the Wady el-Jindy leads through
a narrow defile up toward Bethlehem. Its more important
branch, the Wady es-Sur, runs directly southward past what
are probably to be identified as the ancient Adullam and Keilah,
and thence turning eastward, reaches the uplands near the famous
Maccabean fortress of Bethzur, a little north of Hebron.</p>

<p><b>Valley of Zephathah.</b> The fifth valley is that of Zephathah,
which is known to-day in its upper course as the Wady el-Afranj.
Its western gateway is guarded by the present important city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Beit-Jibrin, the Eleutheropolis of the Greek and Roman period.
Recently opened caves near by reveal the importance of the
Egyptian influence which, at a very early period entered Palestine
along this important highway. The valley itself leads up
through winding, narrow walls past the Plain of Mamre, directly
to Hebron. Along it ran the great road from Jerusalem to
Philistia and Egypt.</p>

<p><b>Wady el-Jizâir.</b> The southernmost valley of western Judah
is a continuation of the Wady el-Hesy, which runs past the
frontier town of Lachish and is to-day known in its extension
into the Judean highlands as the Wady el-Jizâir. Passing the
ancient city of Adoraim, it also led to Hebron and ultimately to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>Significance of These Valleys.</b> Of these six western valleys,
unquestionably the three most important were the Valley of
Ajalon, with its main gateways opening toward Jerusalem, the
Valley of Sorek, with its broad entrance, also leading straight
up to the capital city, and the Valley of Elah, rich with historic
memories. Each of these, however, could be easily defended
at certain strategic points by a few determined men on the heights
above. When these natural gates were closed, Judah was practically
unassailable on the west and could look with a strong
sense of security down from its frowning heights upon the hostile
armies which swept along the broad coast plains.</p>

<p><b>The South Country.</b> The central plateau of Palestine extends
south of Judah fully seventy miles. At first it gradually
descends in a series of terraces, and then breaks into a confusion
of barren, rocky, treeless ridges, running for the most part
from east to west and cut by deep waterless gorges. As in
Judah, the eastern hills which overhang the Wady Arabah are
more abrupt and the winter torrents have cut deep channels in
the gray limestone rocks. On the west the descent is more
gradual, running out into the level wilderness, bounded on the
west by the Wady el-Arish, known to the biblical writers as the
Brook of Egypt. This wild, desolate region, fifty miles wide
and seventy long, is the famous South Country, which figured so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
largely in early Israelite history. Its name, <i>Negeb</i>, Dry Land,
well describes its general character.<sup><a href="#z1">(1)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Its Northern and Western Divisions.</b> The hill country
immediately to the south of Judah is fairly fertile. Cultivated
fields are found in the valleys and terraces on the hillsides,
even as far as the Wady Sheba and the famous desert sanctuary
of Beersheba. To the south and west of Beersheba are found
the ruins of many cities, which evidently enjoyed high prosperity
during the later Roman period. Here, as throughout most of
the South Country, rain falls during the winter season, so that
where the water is stored, irrigation is possible. A few springs
also furnish a perennial supply of water. Thus under a strong
stable government, the northern and northwestern portions of
the South Country are capable of supporting a large, semi-agricultural
population. By nature, however, it is the land of the
nomad. Throughout most of its history, the Bedouin have
dominated it as they do to-day. When undeveloped by irrigation,
its hills and valleys are covered in springtime by a green
herbage, which disappears, except in some secluded glens, before
the glaring heat of summer. To the south, the Negeb at
last descends to the great barren desert of Tîh, across which
ran the highways to Egypt, to Arabia, and to Babylonia.</p>

<p><b>Its Central and Eastern Divisions.</b> The central and
eastern part of this South Country is dry and barren and occupied
only by fierce Bedouin tribes. The absence of water, the
ruggedness of its mountain ranges, and the fierceness of its population
have rendered it almost impassable throughout most of
its history. Many portions of it are still unexplored. Thus,
on its southern boundary, Judah was thoroughly protected from
the advance of hostile armies. At the same time, from this
South Country there came a constant infiltration of the population
and ideas of the desert, which left a deep imprint upon
the character of the southern Israelites.</p>

<p><b>The Striking Contrasts Between Judah and Samaria.</b>
The contrasts between the hills of Judah and Samaria are
many and significant. The hills of Samaria are a collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
distinct groups, divided by broad valleys, which intersect the
land in every direction. The hills of Judah, in contrast, constitute
a great, elevated, solid plateau, cut by no great valleys
running throughout the land from east to west or from north
to south. Judah is a mountain fortress, with strong natural
barriers on every side. Samaria, on the contrary, stands with
doors wide open to the foreign trader and invader. Its inhabitants
are compelled to resort to the hilltops, or else to build strong
fortresses for their defence. The great highways of commerce
pass on either side of Judah, while they ran through the heart
of Samaria. Judah was secure, not only because of its natural
battlements of rock, but because of its barrenness. Its grim
limestone hills, its stony moorlands, and its dry valleys offered
few attractions to the invader. On the other hand, the rich
fields of Samaria and its opulent cities were a constant loadstone,
drawing toward them conquerors from the north, south,
and east.</p>

<p><b>Effect Upon Their Inhabitants.</b> Judah, with its few springs
and its rock-strewn fields, offered a frugal livelihood to men who
were willing to toil and to live without the luxuries of life. It
bred a sturdy, brave race, intensely loyal to their rocks and hills,
tenacious of their beliefs, even to the point of bigotry and martyrdom.
Like their limestone hills, they were grim and unattractive,
but capable of resisting the wearing process of the
centuries. In contrast, the fertile hills of Samaria, with their
plentiful springs and rushing streams, bred a luxury-loving,
care-free, tolerant race, who were ready, almost eager, for foreign
ideas and cults, as well as customs. Thus that great schism
between north and south, between Jew and Samaritan, was
not merely the result of later rivalries, but found its primal
cause in the physical characteristics that distinguished the land
of Judah from that of Samaria.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>THE JORDAN AND DEAD SEA VALLEY</h3>


<p><b>Geological History.</b> The great gorge of the Jordan and
Dead Sea valley is the most striking natural phenomenon in
Palestine. No place on the face of the earth has had a more
dramatic geological history. As has already been noted (p. 14),
this great rift which runs from northern Syria to the Red Sea
was probably formed in the latter part of the Pliocene Age.
At the northern end of the Dead Sea its bed reaches a depth of
nearly one-half a mile beneath the ocean level. It is thus by
far the deepest depression on the face of the earth. During the
Pluvial period this huge rift was filled with water, making a
large inland sea, fully two hundred miles long, with its surface
nearly one hundred feet above the ocean level. Apparently the
higher land to the south of the present Dead Sea cut off the
ocean, so that at the first it was a fresh-water lake. During the
Interglacial period, possibly in part as the result of volcanic
changes, it fell to a level of not more than three hundred feet
above the present surface of the Dead Sea. It was during
this period and the ice age that followed that the deposits were
made on the side of the valley, which have given it its present
terraced form.</p>

<p><b>Evidences of Volcanic Action.</b> From the Pluvial period
to the present the valley has been the scene of frequent volcanic
disturbances. The water, sinking through the great
rifts and subterranean passages, and being transformed by
the heat into steam, forced up great masses of lava, which may
be traced at many points on the heights both to the east and to
the west of the Jordan valley. Earthquakes, many of them
severe, are still common in this volcanic region. That of 1837<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
destroyed the city of Safed, killing one thousand of its inhabitants.
In recent years severe shocks were felt in June, 1896,
January, 1900, March and December, 1903. Many copious,
hot, mineral springs still bear testimony to the presence of volcanic
forces. Those near Tiberias, on the eastern side of the
Sea of Galilee and in the Wady Zerka Ma'in, east of the Dead
Sea, have a temperature of about 144°, while the waters of El-Hammeh
in the Yarmuk Valley vary in temperature from about
93° to 110.° These springs are strongly impregnated with mineral
salts and it is from these and similar sources that the salts
have come that make the waters of the Dead Sea what they are
to-day, heavy and far more saline than the ocean itself.</p>

<p><b>Natural Divisions.</b> The Jordan and Dead Sea valley falls
into four natural divisions: (1) the upper Jordan, from Mount
Hermon to the Sea of Galilee, (2) the Sea of Galilee, (3) the
lower Jordan, and (4) the Dead Sea. At its northernmost
point rises Mount Hermon, called by the natives Jebel es-Sheik,
that is, Mountain of the White-haired.</p>

<p><b>Mount Hermon.</b> Hermon is in reality a massive mountain
plateau, twenty miles long from northeast to southwest. Like
most of the mountains of Palestine, it is of hard limestone,
covered at places with soft chalk. On its northern side the
vineyards run up to a height of almost five thousand feet.<sup><a href="#z27">(27)</a></sup>
Above are found scattered oaks, almond and dwarf juniper trees.
The mountain rises to the height of nine thousand and fifty feet
and is crowned by three peaks.<sup><a href="#z28">(28)</a></sup> The northern and southern
peaks are about the same height, while the western, separated
from the others by a depression, is about one hundred feet lower.
Mount Hermon commands a marvellous view of almost the entire
land of Palestine. From the masses of snow which cover
its broad top far into the summer and lie in its ravines throughout
the year, come the copious waters of the upper Jordan.
Its sources spring from the western and southern bases of Mount
Hermon fully developed streams. Three-fourths of the waters
of Mount Hermon thus find their way down the deep gorge of
the Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><b>Source of the Jordan at Banias.</b> One of the two main
sources of the Jordan is at Banias, the Cæsarea Philippi of
New Testament times. About one hundred feet beneath an
ancient grotto in the side of a sheer cliff, the stream pours
forth from the rocks and goes rushing down through thickets of
trees and the gardens which are irrigated by its waters.<sup><a href="#z29">(29)</a></sup> By
Josephus and other ancient writers the springs at Banias were
regarded as the true source of the Jordan. Here the ancient
Canaanites apparently reared a sanctuary to the god of the
stream and later the Greeks built a temple to Pan, from whence
comes, with the change of the initial letter, the modern name
of Banias, or City of Pan. Here also Herod reared a temple
which was one of the glories of the Roman city.</p>

<p><b>At Tell el-Kadi.</b> The largest source of the Jordan is on
the western side of the mound now known as Tell el-Kadi. A
stream about ten feet wide flows directly from the rock and is
joined by a smaller confluent a little to the south, forming the
so-called El-Leddan. The imposing mound of Tell el-Kadi,
lying at the head of the Jordan Valley and commanding the
highway that leads to Banias, and thence across the eastern
spurs of Mount Hermon to Damascus, is probably the site of
the Canaanite Laish, later the Hebrew Dan.</p>

<p><b>The Western Confluents.</b> A mile and a half further to the
south the two eastern sources of the Jordan are joined by the
Hasbany. This stream springs from a pool on the western
side of Mount Hermon and thence flows southward through
the broad plain on the west of the mountain from which it
sprang. The fourth source of the Jordan, the Nahr Bareighit,
the least important of the four, rising not far from the River
Litany, comes down through a valley to the northwest.</p>

<p><b>The Upper Jordan Valley.</b> During the first part of its
descent to the Dead Sea, the Jordan winds leisurely through a
valley about five miles wide, flanked by hills rising to between
fifteen hundred and two thousand feet.<sup><a href="#z30">(30)</a></sup> Its northernmost
part, under the shadow of Mount Hermon, is plentifully strewn
with stones, but a few miles below Tell el-Kadi fertile grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
fields appear, watered by copious springs. The Jewish colonists
on the northwestern edge of the Jordan valley, are beginning
to cultivate these meadows, again demonstrating how fertile
they are. Six miles above Lake Huleh the river loses itself in
reedy marshes<sup><a href="#z31">(31)</a></sup> and finally empties into the lake through six
different channels. Here the papyrus grows in great profusion.
Lake Huleh itself, four miles long, is little more than a great
malarial marsh, formed by the temporary stopping of the river
by the eastern and western hills, which here approach within
three or four miles of each other.</p>

<p><b>The Rapid Descent to the Sea of Galilee.</b> From Banias to
Lake Huleh the Jordan descends over one thousand feet and
in the eleven miles from the lake to the Sea of Galilee it plunges
downward six hundred and ninety feet. These occasional
pauses, followed by sudden plunges, have given the river its
name, the Jordan, which means the Descender. A little below
Lake Huleh, the valley of the Jordan narrows into a rocky
gorge. Through this rocky chasm, hemmed in by steep cliffs
on both sides, the Jordan plunges in continuous cascades until
it reaches the delta which it has formed at the northern end of
the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p><b>The Sea of Galilee.</b> At Lake Huleh the waters of the
Jordan are seven feet above the ocean level, but at the Sea of
Galilee six hundred and eighty-two feet below. The Sea of
Galilee is a pear-shaped lake, twelve and one-half miles in
length and eight in width, encircled by bold limestone cliffs.<sup><a href="#z32">(32)</a></sup>
Its greatest depth, which is in the north, is seven hundred and
fifty feet. Its blue, clear waters, bathed in sunshine, and the
soft, warm breezes that blow across the lake, make it in spring-time,
and even in winter, one of the most delightful spots in
all the world. In the summer, however, its atmosphere is hot
and sultry, and at many points malarial. Ordinarily, the ocean
winds blow high above the Sea of Galilee without affecting its
hot, tropical climate, but occasionally they pour down through
the valleys, especially to the north and northwest, suddenly
transforming these quiet waters into a tempestuous sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><b>Its Shores.</b> On the east rise the steep, now barren but
probably once tree-clad, limestone hills of the Jaulan, capped
by vast layers of black basalt, towering in the distance like
huge battlements. They stand back, however, from the lake,
leaving a shore averaging one-half mile in width. On the
north the Jordan has worn down the hills, which here descend
gradually in wild, stony moorlands, covered with thorns and
rough grasses. To the northwest opens the fertile plain of
Gennesaret,<sup><a href="#z33">(33)</a></sup> four miles wide, watered by dashing mountain
brooks and flanked by the high hills of upper Galilee. The
industry of German colonists is again beginning to demonstrate
the marvellous fertility of this fair plain, where the
fruits and grains of tropical and temperate climes grow side
by side. On the western side of the lake the hills descend in
terraces, leaving a narrow strip of shore, connected with the
uplands by one or two shallow valleys. To the south the
shore broadens and the hills recede until they are four miles
apart at the southern end,<sup><a href="#z34">(34)</a></sup> where the Jordan leaves the Sea
of Galilee.</p>

<p><b>From the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.</b> The distance
from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea in a straight line is only
sixty-five miles, but, owing to its constant turnings, the actual
course of the river measures nearly two hundred miles. In this
last plunge the river descends more than one thousand feet.
Its descent is more rapid in the upper part of its course. A
little below the Sea of Galilee it receives its largest confluent,
the River Yarmuk, which breaks through the heights of the
Hauran to the east. The volume of the water thus poured in
nearly equals that of the Jordan itself at this point. Further
south the Brook Jalûd comes down on the west from the Plain of
Jezreel past Bethshean. About twenty miles from its mouth,
the Jordan receives the waters from the Jabbok, which descends
from the heights of Gilead on the east, and from the Wady
Farah, which comes from the vicinity of Shechem on the west.</p>

<p><b>Character of the Valley.</b> Below the Sea of Galilee the
Jordan valley, at first but four miles wide, gradually broadens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
until it is eight miles in width opposite Bethshean, where the
valley of Jezreel joins that of the Jordan. Most of the land
in this part of the Jordan valley, immediately below the Sea of
Galilee, is tillable. The ruins of ancient aqueducts indicate
that the streams that come down from the hillsides were once
used for irrigation. The valley is again being in part reclaimed
by Jewish colonists. Ten miles south of Bethshean the Samaritan
headlands crowd close to the Jordan, so that the valley is
only three miles in width. Where the Jabbok and Wady Farah
join the Jordan the valley again broadens until, opposite Jericho,
it is fourteen miles in width.<sup><a href="#z35">(35)</a></sup> Most of this lower Jordan valley
is a parched desert covered by low bushes and desert plants,
except where the streams from the highlands are used for irrigation.
Fertile fields are thus reclaimed where the Wady
Nimrin and the Wady el-Kefrein come from the eastern hills
opposite Jericho. At Jericho itself the waters of the Wady
Kelt and those of the famous Fountain of Elisha are utilized
to-day as they were in ancient times. South of Jericho, however,
the soil is heavily impregnated with saline and alkaline
salts, so that it extends in an almost barren waste to the northern
end of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p><b>The Jordan Itself.</b> Through this broad valley the Jordan
winds, frequently changing its course, and ploughing a great furrow,
called by the natives the Zôr.<sup><a href="#z36">(36)</a></sup> In flood time the river
is from five hundred feet to a mile wide, while in the summer
it is at places not more than seventy-five or a hundred feet in
width and varies in depth from three to twelve feet. At all
times it is a muddy, coffee-colored stream, partaking of the
color of the slimy, alluvial soil through which it flows. Its banks
are covered by thickets of trees, bushes, and reeds, in which
are found many wild beasts and birds. This flood channel of
the Jordan is a scene of wreckage and ruin, mingled with tropical
luxuriance. The lowest bed of this ancient inland lake is
given up to-day, as it always was in the past, to wild beasts, to
occasional fugitives, to squalid Bedouin, and to the muddy,
sprawling river which here rules supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><b>Fords of the Lower Jordan.</b> The lower course of the Jordan
is now spanned by four bridges. In ancient times the
dwellers in Palestine were obliged to depend entirely upon its
fords, of which there are between twenty and twenty-five.
One of the more important is at the point where the river leaves
the Sea of Galilee and is still used as a ferry. Another is the
famous ford of Abarah, a little northeast of Bethshean. The
third is a little farther south, opposite the ancient Pella. Another,
the Dâmieh ford, is at the mouth of the Jabbok. The
fifth is northeast of Jericho just below the point where the Wady
Nimrin enters the Jordan. The most famous is the Pilgrim Ford,
southeast of Jericho, just below the place where the Wady Kelt
joins the Jordan. Owing to the alluvial character of its banks,
its rapid current, and the frequency of the floods, fed by the
melting snows from the Lebanons and by the heavy storms of
the winter and spring, the Jordan has always proved a river
difficult to cross. Its rôle throughout all of its history has
been that of a divider rather than that of a binder together of
tribes and races. Throughout its course of one hundred and
seven miles it is rarely navigable. Flowing, as it does, into
the barren waters of the Dead Sea, the Jordan was, therefore,
a check upon rather than an encouragement to commerce.</p>

<p><b>Ancient Names of the Dead Sea.</b> The residue of the ancient
inland lake is represented by the present Dead Sea. This
name is comparatively modern. In the Bible it is called by
various names, such as simply the Sea, the Sea of the Plain, the
Eastern Sea, or the Salt Sea. To-day it is known among the
Arabs as the Sea of Lot.</p>

<p><b>Its Unique Characteristics.</b> The Dead Sea lies one
thousand two hundred and ninety-two feet below the surface
of the ocean.<sup><a href="#z37">(37)</a></sup> It is forty-seven and a half miles long and
ten miles across at its widest point. At its northeastern end,
under the heights of Moab, the lake reaches to the vast depth
of one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight feet. In
striking contrast, the southern end of the sea is only ten to fifteen
feet in depth. Its waters are so thoroughly impregnated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with poisonous chemicals that no fish can live in them and
only the lowest organisms survive. Its bitter taste is due to
the presence of chloride of magnesium and the oily feeling is
produced by the chloride of calcium, which it holds in solution.
As is well known, the density is so great that it is practically
impossible for man or beast to sink beneath its waters.
In time of storm the waves beat on the shore with a heavy,
metallic sound. The waters of the sea are frequently lashed
by heavy thunder-storms, which linger here sometimes for
hours, held in by the high, towering cliffs on either side. With
few exceptions the shores of the Dead Sea are barren and strewn
at places with the wreckage of trees. Its water, however, is
limpid, varying from light blue to green. Owing to the proximity
of the desert and the intense heat&mdash;the temperature rising
in summer as high as 118°&mdash;it is the scene of a stupendous
process of evaporation. It is computed that between six and
eight million tons of water rise in vapor from this great natural
caldron each day. Often the vapor is so dense that it obscures
the landscape, but at other times it imparts a marvellous
prismatic color to the huge cliffs that encircle the lake,<sup><a href="#z38">(38)</a></sup>
so that the combination of the blue waters, the cloudless skies,
and the rich, blended reds, grays, and purples of the opalescent
landscape make it one of the most sublime views in all the world.</p>

<p><b>Its Eastern Bank.</b> On the eastern side the cliffs of Moab
rise at some points almost sheer to the height of between
twenty-five hundred and three thousand feet. These limestone
hills are mottled with huge blotches of black limestone and
basalt and are frequently capped with white, chalky rocks.
They are cut by several important streams, which have worn
deep canyons that extend back many miles into the Moabite
hills. A few miles south of the northeastern end the Wady
Zerka Ma'in flows into the sea. On its northern bank, near the
sea, the famous baths of Callirrhöe burst from the rock. Farther
south the River Arnon, cutting a canyon three thousand
feet deep through the plateau of Moab, reaches the sea through
a broad opening. Here a few scattered palms and acacias relieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the utter desolation of this eastern wall of rock. Still
farther south the promontory of El-Lisan, The Tongue, as it
is called by the natives, pushes out into the sea, extending to
within three miles of the western shore. It is a bold mass of
calcareous marl, forty to eighty feet in height, treeless and
barren. In pleasing contrast with this barrenness is the oasis
lying behind it, watered by the Wady el-Kerak. Here are found
the four Bedouin villages which are the only towns along the
coast of this desolate sea.</p>

<p><b>The Southern End.</b> At the southern end of the Dead Sea
is a slimy mud marsh, low and malarial, covered with tropical
thickets which are filled with the birds and the beasts of the
southern clime. Farther south is the fertile Ghôr es-Safieh.
In this little oasis, lying between the sea and the wilderness,
a little wheat, barley, and tobacco are grown and a dense tropical
vegetation abounds. Southward for a hundred and twelve
miles to the Gulf of Akaba extends the Arabah,<sup><a href="#z39">(39)</a></sup> the continuation
of the great rift of which the Jordan and the Dead Sea
valleys are a part. Low sand-hills lie across the centre of this
broad, shallow valley, making direct travel impossible. Sixty-five
miles to the south the watershed is reached. This is six
hundred and sixty feet above the level of the ocean, that is, nearly
two thousand feet above the level of the Dead Sea. It is a land
of stones, gravel, and sand,<sup><a href="#z40">(40)</a></sup> with only a few trickling springs&mdash;a
lonesome, forbidding region where heat, dust, and the
Bedouin rule supreme to-day as they have for thousands of
years.</p>

<p><b>The Western Shores.</b> The hills on the western side of the
Dead Sea, except at two points, do not come close to the margin
of the water. A beach from a hundred yards to a mile in
width fringes the sea on this western side. Beyond this shore the
hills rise in terraces to the height of from two thousand to two
thousand five hundred feet. These are white, rounded, and barren,
except at Engedi, where the waters of its famous spring have
developed an oasis,<sup><a href="#z41">(41)</a></sup> which marks the side of the plateau with
a pleasing mass of dark green. Many small wadies cut down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
through these western hills. In their beds are found a few
trees and bushes, but otherwise the landscape is as bold and
unrelieved by vegetation as on the east. On the southwest, at
Jebel Usdum, there is a remarkable range of salt cliffs, six hundred
feet high, three and three-fourth miles in length and a
half mile in width. Here local tradition fixes the scene of the
death of Lot's wife. Along this western shore are also found
deposits of bitumen. Frequently portions of it are found
floating in the waters; sometimes they catch on fire, adding to
the lurid impressiveness of this mysterious valley.</p>

<p><b>Grim Associations of the Dead Sea.</b> These are a few of the
many reminders that fully justify the modern name of the Dead
Sea. Its historic associations, the destruction of the wicked
cities of the plain, the murder of John the Baptist at Machærus
on the eastern heights, and the later massacre at Masada are
all harsh and appalling. In common with the Jordan valley,
this region is richly suggestive of the destructive forces of nature.
Life is here grim, severe, and relentless. It is not difficult
to detect in Jewish character the deep impressions made
by this constant contact with the symbols of death and with
these suggestions of the presence of a stern, austere God.</p>

<h3>THE EAST-JORDAN LAND</h3>


<p><b>Form and Climate of the East-Jordan Land.</b> The east-Jordan
land of biblical history is in form an irregular triangle,
with its base skirting the Jordan Valley, its northern angle at the
foot of Mount Hermon, its southern a little beyond the southern
end of the Dead Sea, while its third angle lies in the Druse
Mountains, about seventy miles east of the Sea of Galilee.
Damascus,<sup><a href="#z42">(42)</a></sup> to the northwest, is just beyond the bounds of
Palestine. This famous ancient city lies in the midst of a verdant
oasis made by the waters of the Abana River,<sup><a href="#z43">(43)</a></sup> which
breaks through the eastern Lebanons and finally loses itself in
the Arabian desert. The heart of the east-Jordan land is the
wide, level plain watered by the tributaries of the Yarmuk
River. The east-Jordan territory is a great elevated plateau,
averaging fully two thousand feet in height. This southern
continuation of the Anti-Lebanon mountains is a land that
lies open to the sunshine and to the strong breezes that blow
from the dry desert or fresh from the western sea. Its temperature,
as a whole, is much colder than that of western Palestine.
Frosts at night begin as early as the first of November and continue
into March. Deep snows cover a large portion of it in
winter. I myself have travelled in the middle of March for
hours through blinding snows, two or three feet deep, up among
the highlands of Gilead. In summer frequent mists sweep over
the heights. At night the temperature often falls very low,
and, as a result, heavy dews are deposited. Even during the
day cool sea-breezes make the air thoroughly invigorating.
Thus it richly deserved the reputation which it enjoyed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
antiquity of being one of the most healthful regions in all the
world.</p>

<p><b>Well Watered and Fertile.</b> In contrast to western Palestine,
the east-Jordan land is well supplied with springs and
perennial rivers. Grass grows almost everywhere in rich
profusion, even far out toward the desert. Great forests are
still found in Gilead, and fruit trees that yield abundantly.
East of the Jordan are the chief grain fields of Palestine, but
it is pre-eminently the home of the herdsman and shepherd.
Herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats dot the landscape
almost everywhere from the foot of Hermon to the southern
end of Moab.</p>

<p><b>The Four Great Natural Divisions.</b> The east-Jordan
land falls into four great natural divisions. The first is the
Jaulan or Golan, the Gaulanitis of the Roman period, which
extends from the foot of Mount Hermon to the Yarmuk River
and from the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee to the Nahr el-Allân,
a northern tributary of the Yarmuk. To the east and
southeast of the Jaulan is the second great division, the Hauran.
It extends northward to the vast lava-beds of El-Lejah, and eastward
to the Druse Mountains, which look out upon the desert.
In certain passages of the Old Testament the term Bashan
seems to have been applied to the entire region north of the
Yarmuk, but its exact bounds are not clearly defined. The
third division includes the mountains of Gilead, which extend
from the Yarmuk to the Wady Heshbân at the northern end of
the Dead Sea, and from the Jordan out to the desert beyond the
territory of ancient Ammon. The fourth division is the plateau
of Moab, which extends from the Wady Heshbân to the Wady
el-Hesa, southeast of the Dead Sea, and from the Salt Sea to the
great pilgrim road on the borders of the desert.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics of the Northern and Western Jaulan.</b>
The Jaulan slopes southward to the Yarmuk and westward
to the Jordan. Its characteristic features are two parallel
ranges of isolated volcanic mountains between two and four
thousand feet in height extending southward from Mount Hermon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>In some of these bold peaks the outlines of the ancient
craters are still visible. Tell Abu Neda, of the western range,
rises to the height of nearly four thousand feet. Its crater is
broken at one side and its ulterior is cultivated, producing a
variety of vegetables and grains. Another peak farther south,
Tell el-Faras, about three thousand one hundred feet high, has
a well-preserved, round crater, which inclines to the north.
From these craters in early times successive waves of lava flowed
toward the Jordan valley, covering this entire region. The northern
part of the Jaulan is a great rocky pasture land, strewn with
black basaltic boulders. In the spring it is a mass of green,
which attracts thousands of Bedouin with their flocks. In the
summer it becomes dry and desolate except where a few perennial
springs develop little oases. The villages are small and
far apart. Inland a few wadies supply water for irrigation, but
as they run westward toward the Jordan they soon cut deep
torrent beds through the rocks and thus become practically useless
for purposes of agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Southern and Eastern Jaulan.</b> The southern part of the
Jaulan, from a point opposite the northern end of the Sea of
Galilee, is a lofty plateau. Here the volcanic rock is more
broken. In this rich, dark red soil much grain is raised, especially
wheat and barley. Two important streams, the Wady
Semakh and the Wady Fîk, here descend to the Sea of Galilee
through long deep gorges. The southeastern Jaulan is pierced
by two parallel streams, the Nahr er-Rukkad and the Nahr el-Allân,
which run almost due south. In their upper courses they
flow on the surface of the ground, but soon sink into deep
gorges which lead to the Yarmuk. The Yarmuk itself is the
most commanding river of all the east-Jordan land. Its tributaries
water the fertile lands of the Hauran. Like all the great
rivers east of the Jordan, it has cut a deep channel through the
basaltic rocks. To-day the railroad from Damascus to Haifa
twists along its tortuous course between walls of rock five hundred
to one thousand feet in height. The climate in this deep
gorge is that of the Jordan valley itself. Oleanders, palms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
figs grow here, overshadowed by the pines and oaks of the upland
plateau. The variety of twisted and tilted limestone
and volcanic rocks laid bare on its rugged sides makes it one
of the wildest and most picturesque valleys in all Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Character of the Hauran.</b> The most productive grain
fields of the eastern Mediterranean are found in the Hauran
or Hollow.<sup><a href="#z1">(1)</a></sup> With the exception of an occasional low hill, this
region is as level as a floor. The soil is a rich volcanic loam,
well watered and superlatively fruitful. Unlike the Jaulan,
which was once largely wooded, it is treeless, except among
the mountains to the east. It is also one of the few spots in
Palestine practically free from stones. Here wheat and barley
and the other grains of Palestine grow in rankest profusion.
The landscape is comparatively monotonous except as an occasional
wady furrows its way down toward the Yarmuk or
some of its tributaries. Like many regions in Palestine it is
dominated by the snowy heights of Hermon, which stand out
in brilliant contrast to the monotony of the plain.</p>

<p><b>Borderland of the Hauran.</b> To the north rises, thirty
or forty feet above the plain, the great lava plain of El-Lejah.
It is a solid, gently undulating mass of lava, containing an area
of three hundred and fifty square miles. No rivers, and only
occasional springs, are found throughout this barren waste,
which is penetrated only by a few footpaths. It is the ancient
Trachonitis, the refuge of outlaws and robbers to-day as in the
past. To the east the plain of the Hauran rises to Jebel Hauran,
also known as the Druse Mountains. Three of the peaks of
these eastern sentinels are between four and six thousand feet
high. On the south, the Hauran gradually merges into the
yellow steppes of El-Hamâd and farther west into the limestone
hills of Ez-Zumleh.</p>

<p><b>Gilead.</b> South of the Yarmuk the black basalt of the Jaulan
yields to the light limestone of the west-Jordan. The entire
territory of Gilead more closely resembles the western hills of
Palestine than does any other part of the east-Jordan region.
On the broad rolling uplands of eastern Gilead there are large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
grain fields and the soil is cultivated at many other points. In
the Roman period great cities, of which Gerasa<sup><a href="#z44">(44)</a></sup> was the chief,
testified to the rich productivity of this region, but for the most
part it is the paradise of the herdsmen and the shepherd. It is
a land of deep valleys, rounded hills, and frequent springs.
On the northwest many small streams cut their way to the
Jordan valley. The roads run up and down steep inclines
where the flocks and the herds cling to the sloping hillsides.
Groves of noble oaks cover the hilltops and reveal the strength
inherent in the soil.</p>

<p><b>The Jabbok and Jebel Osha.</b> The dominant factor in
southern Gilead is the River Jabbok.<sup><a href="#z45">(45)</a></sup> It rises among the
hills not far from the Moabite border, only eighteen miles from
the Jordan, and then flows northeast, past the old Ammonite
capital. Thence it completes the half circle, cutting its way
through the Gileadite hills to the Jordan. At some points its
channel is between two and three thousand feet below the
level of the plateau. It is a joyous river, rippling in flashes of
sunlight over the rocks, through green glades and tangles of
oleanders and rushes, a type of this happy, picturesque land of
the shepherd. The centre of the half circle described by the
Brook Jabbok is the Jebel Osha, the highest peak in Gilead.
From its height of three thousand five hundred and ninety-five
feet, practically all of Gilead is spread to the north and south
and east like a great variegated carpet.</p>

<p><b>Southern Gilead.</b> In southern Gilead the trees become
fewer and fewer until south of Jebel Osha they almost disappear.
In spring-time the fields are green with grass and grain,
but in summer they become parched and brown. The wadies
in the south, such as Wady Nimrin and Wady Heshbân, avail
little for irrigation, since their channels are far beneath the level
of the surrounding plateau. The region as a whole begins to
take on something of the sombre color of the Dead Sea region
which lies in the depths below.</p>

<p><b>Character of the Plateau of Moab.</b> In its largest bounds
Moab is a territory sixty miles long and thirty miles wide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
From across the Dead Sea it looks like a high mountain range,
but in reality it is simply a lofty upland plateau<sup><a href="#z46">(46)</a></sup> towering
above the deep gorge of the Dead Sea. Throughout most of
its extent it is between two thousand five hundred and three
thousand three hundred feet above the ocean level, and therefore
from three thousand eight hundred to four thousand six
hundred feet above the blue waters of the Dead Sea. It is
a gently rolling, treeless plain; its low hilltops are crowned
with the ruins of ancient cities. Only a few bushes are to
be found upon these bare moors. The prevailing rock is
soft cretaceous limestone, which crops out at many points.
The soil of the central zone, however, which runs from north
to south, averaging about ten miles in width, is exceedingly
fertile. Many grain fields are found throughout this territory;
but like Gilead, Moab is pre-eminently the land of the herdsman
and the shepherd. In the wadies which run down to the
Dead Sea thousands of camels are bred, while on the hills
above are seen at every point flocks of cattle, sheep, and goats.</p>

<p><b>Its Fertility and Water Supply.</b> In the spring-time the upland
fields are masses of green, which almost conceal the stones
and outcrop of rock. The marvel is that any vegetation is
found in a land thus bounded, on the west by the Sea of Death
and on the east by the rocky desert. Most of the streams run
through deep glens and no springs are found on the surface.
The explanation of the marvel is found in the high elevation of
the plateau and the great process of evaporation which is ever
going on in the Dead Sea basin below. The west winds from
the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea come laden with moisture,
which they deposit in the winter and spring in drenching rains,
and throughout the year in heavy dews at night.</p>

<p><b>Its Mountains.</b> The mountains of Moab are little more
than hills rising a few hundred feet above the rolling upland.
The so-called mountains of the Abarim are simply the wild,
rocky hills and promontories which rise rapidly from the Dead
Sea.<sup><a href="#z47">(47)</a></sup> Seen from across the Dead Sea they have the appearance
of mountains. They skirt the eastern side of the lower Jordan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and Dead Sea, running eastward nine or ten miles to meet
the fields of Moab on the heights. This region corresponds to
the wilderness of Judea across the sea on the west. Mount
Nebo, which now bears the name Neba, is a flat tongue of land
two thousand six hundred and forty-three feet above the ocean
level, running out two miles westward from the main plateau.
It overlooks the northern end of the Dead Sea, which is nearly
four thousand feet below. It commands a marvellous view
up the Jordan valley, between the lofty heights of Gilead on
the right and the hills of Samaria and Judah on the left. Farther
inland and to the south is the loftier peak of Jebel Attarus.
The chief mountain south of the Arnon is Jebel Shihan,
which rises to the height of two thousand seven hundred and
eighty feet above the ocean level.</p>

<p><b>Its Rivers.</b> The most striking features in the landscape of
Moab are the deep canyons which plough from east to west
across the plateau. Those in the north run back only a few
miles, leaving northeastern Moab a comparatively unbroken
plateau, but in the south they cut deep furrows eastward even
to the borders of the desert. The Wady Zerka Ma'in has
worn a broad channel through the limestone, basaltic, and sandstone
rocks of northwestern Moab, so that ten miles from the
point where it flows into the Dead Sea it is fully two miles
across. Along the bottom of this great chasm runs a limpid
brook, winding through beautiful groves of oleanders and beside
fertile patches of land, which are in marked contrast to
the utterly barren and desolate cliffs above.</p>

<p><b>The Arnon.</b> Farther south the Arnon, the chief river of
Moab, rises on the border of the desert. Rapidly cutting its
way down into the plateau, it receives its first important confluent
from the south, and farther on the Wady Waleh from the north.
At the point where the central highway through Moab from the
north crosses the Arnon the canyon is three thousand feet deep
and two miles from bank to bank. It is by far the most stupendous
and picturesque chasm in all Palestine.<sup><a href="#z48">(48)</a></sup> The
steep red cliffs, variegated and richly colored by white, gray, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
yellow strata, extend in wavy billows east and west as far as
the eyes can reach. The descent is almost sheer into the depths
below, where the river, easily fordable at many points and with
an actual channel only a few feet wide, rushes over the smooth
rocks or winds leisurely through its fringe of oleanders and
green bushes. Where the tributary wadies have cut down the
soft limestone, nature's castles stand out, guarding the broad
natural highway from the desert to the sea. The Arnon only
in a lesser degree separated the land of Moab and destroyed
its political unity, even as did the Jordan the land of Israel.</p>

<p><b>Southern Moab and Edom.</b> Farther south the Wady el-Kerak,
narrow and deep, runs past both sides of the natural
citadel, whose name it bears,<sup><a href="#z49">(49)</a></sup> and finds its way to the Dead
Sea back of the barren promontory of El-Lisan. Thus the
three zones of Moab, the western promontories, the central fields,
and the dry pasture lands on the east, are repeatedly intersected
by the deep gorges that make it a land easy to approach from
the desert and difficult to defend. Farther south the plateau
of Moab merges into the wild, picturesque mountains of Mount
Seir, the home of the Edomites. The valley becomes narrower
and the mountains bolder, more jagged, and abrupt. The culmination
of these natural wonders is the Wady Mûsa, which
cuts a deep, narrow channel through the heart of the mountains.<sup><a href="#z50">(50)</a></sup>
In the midst of this valley, surrounded by gorgeously
colored sandstone cliffs, out of which have been carved homes,
streets, tombs, theatres, temples,<sup><a href="#z51">(51)</a></sup> and well-preserved high
places,<sup><a href="#z52">(52,</a> <a href="#z53">53)</a></sup> stands that most astonishing and marvellous of all
oriental cities&mdash;Petra.</p>

<p><b>Significance of the East-Jordan Land.</b> Health, beauty,
and fertility have ever been the three rich possessions of the
east-Jordan land. It was effectually cut off, however, from
contact with the teeming, highly civilized life of the Mediterranean
seaboard by the deep chasm of the Jordan and Dead
Sea valley and by the barren hills that flanked this great gorge on
its southern end. It was a land that faced the desert and the
east rather than the west. It was itself the loadstone that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
constantly attracted the wandering dwellers of the desert.
The life and institutions of the desert have here prevailed
through all the centuries. Here the wandering nomads first
tasted and learned to appreciate the advantages of settled agricultural
life and made the gradual and natural transition from
the nomadic to the agricultural state. Here also the mighty
energies of the powerful western nations were put forth in a
mighty effort to conquer and to hold this land, for they realized
that it was their natural eastern outpost against the desert. It
was here, therefore, that the militant civilization and life of the
East and West met, struggled, and mingled. Here the same
conflicts and processes are going on to-day as in the past.
This close contact with the desert has always been the strength,
the significance, and the weakness of the east-Jordan land.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>THE TWO CAPITALS: JERUSALEM AND
SAMARIA</h3>


<p><b>Importance of Jerusalem and Samaria.</b> Two cities of
ancient Palestine, Jerusalem and Samaria, towered above all
others, both in size and in importance. Each was for a long
period the capital of an important kingdom. Each represented
a distinct type of civilization and religion. Their topography
throws much light upon their development and history.</p>

<p><b>Site of Jerusalem.</b> At first glance the site of Jerusalem seems
one of the most unpromising places in all the land of Palestine
for a great city. It lies on two or three low hills, projecting from
the irregular plateau, which extends southward from the watershed
of central Judah. It is overshadowed by higher hills
near by and has no lofty, commanding acropolis. The Wilderness
of Judea bounds it on the east and the hills and valleys
about are rocky and comparatively barren. The reason why
a city originally sprang up on this forbidding site was the
presence of a spring, now known as the Virgin's Spring, on the
side of the Kidron Valley<sup><a href="#z54">(54)</a></sup> to the southeast of the present
Jerusalem. It is the one perennial spring in this region and
fixes at once the site of the old pre-Israelite town. (<i>Cf.</i> map op.
p. 203.)</p>

<p><b>The Kidron Valley.</b> The Kidron is a characteristic Palestinian
wady. It runs almost due north past the city and then
gradually bends to the west. It is about two hundred yards
in width and is flanked by hills, which rise four to six hundred
feet on either side. During the winter and spring rains a
brook rushes down this ravine, but in the summer it is waterless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
although many olive trees find sufficient moisture in the
bottom and on sides of the valley. At its southern end the
Kidron is joined by the broad valley of Ben Hinnom,<sup><a href="#z55">(55)</a></sup> which
runs due west nearly half a mile and then turns northward,
thus, with the Kidron, enclosing on three sides a nearly regular
rectangle half to three-quarters of a mile in width.</p>

<p><b>The Tyrop&oelig;on Valley.</b> The southern promontories or
hills thus enclosed were in ancient times divided by a small
shallow valley, the Tyrop&oelig;on or Cheesemongers' Valley, which
ran northward from the Valley of Hinnom, separating the
rectangle into two unequal parts. The city has been so often
besieged and razed to the ground that its original site has been
largely obscured by the masses of débris scattered everywhere
and especially in the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley. At many points the
native rock lies from forty to one hundred feet beneath the
present level. East of the temple area a shaft was sunk one
hundred and twenty feet before the virgin rock was reached.
Hundreds of such shafts have been sent down at different points
throughout the city so that the exact site of the ancient town is
now well known. The Tyrop&oelig;on Valley, which cuts through
the heart of Jerusalem, is the key to the understanding of the
ancient city. From the point where it joins the Kidron and
Hinnom valleys in the south to its northern end, a little outside
the present Damascus Gate, this valley is about sixteen hundred
yards in length. The hills on either side originally rose to
the height of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty
feet above the bottom of the valley, which becomes broader and
shallower toward the north. Opposite the present temple
area a western branch extends about three hundred yards,
nearly cutting off the southwestern hill from the northern
plateau.</p>

<p><b>The Original City.</b> The rounded ridge of rock between the
Tyrop&oelig;on and Kidron valleys was clearly the original site of Jerusalem.
It is the so-called Ophel, on which the ancient Jebusite
fortress was reared. The southern end rises rapidly from the
valley below where the Tyrop&oelig;on and Kidron join. Its northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
continuation is the temple area. Excavations have shown
that immediately north of the present temple area there was a
rock cutting, from the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley on the west to the
Kidron Valley on the east, leaving a precipice of native rock
twenty-five feet high as a barrier against attack from the north.
At the southeastern corner of the temple area traces have also
been found of the well-built wall which ran along the edge of
the Kidron Valley, probably encircling the ancient Jebusite city.
Thus it was surrounded on three sides with rapidly descending
valleys from one to three hundred feet deep, while immediately
below was the perennial spring, essential to the life of its early
inhabitants. It is easy, therefore, to understand why the early
Jebusites regarded their city as impregnable.</p>

<p><b>Its Extent.</b> The hill Ophel contains an area of between sixteen
and eighteen acres, which was amply sufficient for a crowded
village of ancient times. This was also, without reasonable
doubt, the site of David's city. As the Israelite city grew it
probably extended almost to the level of the valley in the south,
near the modern Pool of Siloam. At present the northern end
of the hill Ophel is higher than the southern. It also broadens
into the temple area, which is two thousand four hundred and
forty feet above the sea-level. It is not improbable, however,
that the site of the old Jebusite fortress was once higher than the
temple rock to the north. If the fortress of Akra, which figures
prominently in Maccabean history, was identical with the ancient
citadel of Ophel, then, according to the testimony of Josephus
(<i>Jew. Wars</i>, V, 4:1), Simon the Maccabean ruler cut down this
southern eminence to make it lower than the adjoining temple
area.</p>

<p><b>The Western Hill.</b> It is not clear when the western hill
was included within the bounds of Jerusalem; possibly in the
days of Solomon; certainly some time before the Babylonian
exile. On the south and west this hill descends rapidly to the
Valley of Hinnom, on the east to the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley; while
on the north it is connected by a narrow neck of rock with the
northern hill of Jerusalem. It is about seven hundred yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
long from north to south and four hundred from east to west.
It is highest on the west, where it is two thousand five hundred
and twenty feet above the sea-level. It is therefore about eighty
feet higher than the temple area to the east.</p>

<p><b>The Northern Extension of the City.</b> As the city grew
in later times, it extended naturally to the north and included
the little hill or knob directly north of the so-called western
hill, with which it was connected by a neck of rock. This
northern hill was bounded on the west by a depression running
from the Hinnom Valley and on the south and east by the upper
Tyrop&oelig;on. On the north it had no natural defence.<sup><a href="#z56">(56)</a></sup> Its
highest point, about two thousand four hundred and ninety feet,
was nearly on the same level as the temple area. The northern
extension of the city also included another section of the ridge
of rock which runs northward from the temple area, parallel to
the Kidron Valley. A scarp twenty feet deep was cut across
this ridge from east to west and to-day forms the northeastern
limits of the city. In contrast to the ancient city, which extended
far down into the valleys to the south, the modern city
has climbed up the plateau toward the north.</p>

<p><b>Josephus's Description of Jerusalem.</b> The late Jewish
historian, Josephus, has given the most graphic description of
the topography of Jerusalem. In the light of the preceding
study of its site, his vivid picture becomes clearly intelligible.
While he had in mind the city of his own day (the middle of
the first Christian century) his words describe equally well the
ancient town: "The city of Jerusalem was fortified with three
walls, on such parts as were not surrounded with impassable
valleys; for in such places it had but one wall. The city was
built upon two hills, which are opposite to one another, and
have a valley to divide them asunder, at which valley the corresponding
houses on both hills end. Of these hills, that which
contains the upper city is much higher, and in length more
direct. But the other hill, which was called the Acra, and sustains
the lower city, is of the shape of a moon when it is horned;
over against this there was a third hill, but naturally lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
than the Acra, and parted formerly from the other by a broad
valley. However, in those times, when the Asmoneans reigned,
they filled up that valley with earth, and had a mind to join the
city to the temple. They then took off part of the height of
Acra and reduced it to a less elevation than it was before, that
the temple might be superior to it. Now the Valley of the
Cheesemongers, as it was called, which separated the hill
of the upper city from that of the lower, extended as far as Siloam;
for that is the name of a fountain which has sweet water
in it, and this also in great plenty. But on the outside these
hills are surrounded by deep valleys, and by reason of the precipices
belonging to them, they are on both sides everywhere inaccessible."</p>

<p><b>The Geological Formation.</b> The geological formation of
the hills of Jerusalem also throws much light upon its history.
The strata is inclined toward the southeast at an average angle
of ten or twelve degrees. The surface rock is hard, silicious
limestone with bands of flint. This crops out on the top of the
temple mount, on the west side of the Kidron Valley, and in the
quarries to the north of Jerusalem. Below is a bed of soft, white
limestone, easy to cut and good for building, since it hardens
with exposure. The presence of this underlying rock made
possible the extensive system of cisterns and underground
passages with which Jerusalem is honeycombed and which has
played such a large part in the tragic history of the city. Beneath
this layer is a hard, dolomitic limestone, white but streaked
with pink. While the upper layers of rock are porous, this
lower stratum holds the water, with the result that at the one
point where it comes to the surface on the western side of the
lower Kidron Valley there is a spring. The southern inclination
of this hard rock also carries the drainage of the city to the
south, to the point where the Kidron and Hinnom valleys meet.</p>

<p><b>The Water Supply.</b> Jerusalem, like most of the cities of
Judah, was inadequately supplied with springs. The Virgin's
Spring, which is in all probability identical with the ancient
spring of Gihon, is intermittent. Its waters issue from a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
siphon in the rock, flowing according to the local rainfall,
sometimes for only an hour or more, and at others for several
days. It is entered by steps which lead into a natural cave, half
way down the side of the Kidron Valley. From this point, in
early times, the waters were conducted through the ridge of
rock on which the city rested by a rock-cut tunnel, which is
one of the wonders of ancient engineering. Thence they were
carried to a point at the southern end of the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley,
where was once the famous Pool of Siloam, which was probably
inside the ancient city walls. Here was built in later times a
great basin, fifty-two feet square, from which the inhabitants of
the city drew their chief supply of water.<sup><a href="#z112">(112)</a></sup> Still another conduit
carried the overflow from this pool to the so-called Job's
Well, four hundred and fifty yards to the southeast, where the
Kidron and the Hinnom valleys meet. West of the temple area
there was apparently in ancient times a pool which received the
waters from the upper basin of the Tyrop&oelig;on, but there is no
clear geological or historical evidence of a living spring in the
northern or western part of the city. Aside from their one
perennial spring and these pools the inhabitants of ancient Jerusalem
were wholly dependent upon rock-cisterns for their
water supply. Modern excavations have revealed the remains
of the aqueducts, by which the plentiful waters of the so-called
Pools of Solomon, southwest of Bethlehem, were later conducted
through the valleys and along the hillsides to Jerusalem. The
water was then distributed by means of high and low level
aqueducts in different parts of the city, but especially in the
temple area, for use in connection with the sacrificial ritual.
From the same Pools of Solomon water is still brought by pipes
to the southwestern side of the city.<sup><a href="#z57">(57)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Jerusalem's Military Strength.</b> Jerusalem's strength consisted
not in its elevation, but in the deep ravines which encircled
it on the east, south, west, and in part on the north.
The native rock lay only a few feet beneath the surface, and
the soft limestone could be cut with comparative ease. A
vertical cutting of twenty or twenty-five feet into the steep side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the hill gave a precipitous rampart of native rock, indestructible
and difficult to scale. The weakness of Jerusalem was the
lack of natural defences on the north.<sup><a href="#z56">(56)</a></sup> This natural defect
was partially overcome by the deep cuttings in the natural
rock, which at certain points left a sheer descent of twenty or
twenty-five feet. These artificial defences were supplemented
in the more level places by broad, strong walls that made Jerusalem,
throughout most of its history, the strongest citadel in
Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Strength of Its Position.</b> The city shared with the rest of
Judah the protection of natural barriers on every side. It
could be approached on the east only over the rough headlands
that arose above the Jordan and the Dead Sea. While it was
on the great highway which led along the central plateau from
northern Israel to Hebron and the South Country, large invading
armies never advanced against Jerusalem by this difficult
mountain road. On the west the valleys which led up from
the coast plains converged at Jerusalem, making it comparatively
easy for the Hebrews in command of these upland passages
to descend rapidly upon their foes in the plain. These
passes were also easily guarded from above against advancing
armies. The comparative barrenness of the territory
about Jerusalem was another important source of its strength,
for the land furnished insufficient sustenance for a large besieging
army. Thus Jerusalem, although close to the great currents
of the world's civilization, stood apart and aloof, secure
because of its poverty and comparative insignificance, secure
behind its bold western headlands and its walls of gray limestone.<sup><a href="#z58">(58)</a></sup>
It was the fitting capital of an austere race, who jealously
and bravely guarded their freedom and their faith. Shut
in among the limestone hills, it was typical of the land of Judah.</p>

<p><b>Samaria's Name.</b> Samaria, situated in the midst of a
broad, fertile plain, opening toward the sea and commanding
far-reaching, glorious vistas, was equally representative of
northern Israel. Both capitals were raised to the commanding
position which they enjoyed, not as the result of chance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
through the deliberate choice of a strong and able sovereign.
In I Kings 16:24 it is stated that Omri, the founder of the
most powerful military dynasty of northern Israel, "bought
the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and
he built on the hill and named the city Samaria, after Shemer,
the owner of the hill." Whatever be its historical derivation,
the name Shomeron, or Samaria, is eminently appropriate,
for it means watch-tower.</p>

<p><b>Its Situation.</b> The hill lies on the eastern side of the Wady
esh-Shair or Barley Vale, a wide and beautiful valley, which
comes up from the Plain of Sharon. Opposite Samaria it
broadens out and unites with several shallow valleys, which
come down from the north and northeast. Along the Barley
Vale runs the great highway which leads northwest from Shechem
and central Israel to the Plain of Esdraelon and Ph&oelig;nicia. Another
highway runs directly north, past the Plain of Dothan
to northern Israel and Damascus. Samaria lay near the border
line between the powerful tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.
It was, however, a little south and east of the centre of
northern Israel. Its gates were wide open to the civilization
and commerce which swept up and down the coast plains.
From the city's heights there was a fine view of the Mediterranean,
which represented that larger world into close touch
with which Omri aimed to bring his people.</p>

<p><b>Its Military Strength.</b> The city was built on an elongated,
isolated hill,<sup><a href="#z59">(59)</a></sup> rising on the west between three and four hundred
feet above the plain. The hill descends precipitously on
three sides; on the east it is connected with the hills by a neck
of land which lies about two hundred feet above the surrounding
plain. As in the case of Jerusalem, these surrounding
valleys were the source of its military strength. The hill is
about three-fourths of a mile in length. On its top rises a
large acropolis,<sup><a href="#z60">(60)</a></sup> nearly round and about a third of a mile
in diameter. In the Roman period this acropolis was surrounded
by a wide terrace, with a colonnade about one and one-half
miles in circumference. On the top of this rounded hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
there was ample space for a large and powerful city. Surrounded,
like Jerusalem, by a strong wall, it was practically
impregnable.</p>

<p><b>Its Beauty and Prosperity.</b> The view from Samaria is one
of the most picturesque and attractive in all Palestine. Isaiah
well describes this city as "the splendid ornament which crowns
the fertile valley." Green fields, olive and vine-clad hills delight
the eye on every side. Between the hills may be seen
glimpses of green, peaceful valleys. Plenty and prosperity are
in evidence at every turn. Samaria itself lies one thousand four
hundred and fifty-four feet above the sea-level and is surrounded
by higher hills on nearly every side. Two miles to the north
is a hill between nine hundred and a thousand feet higher than
that of Samaria, while to the southeast other hills lead up to
the rocky heights of Mount Ebal, over three thousand feet above
the sea-level. Thus Samaria was a symbol of the beauty, the
prosperity, the openness to foreign influence, the inherent
strength and the fatal weakness of northern, as contrasted
with southern Israel.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT HIGHWAYS OF THE BIBLICAL WORLD</h3>


<p><b>Importance of the Highways.</b> Upon the direction and
character of the highways depend to a great extent the growth
and history of early civilization. By the great roads which entered
Palestine the Hebrews came as immigrants. Along the
same roads those later waves of both hostile and peaceful
invasion swept in upon them that largely shaped their history.
These highways were to them the open doors to the life and
civilization of the outside world. Over these same roads the
Hebrews later fled as fugitives or were dragged as captives.
Along these channels of communication and commerce the
missionaries and apostles at a still later day went forth to their
peaceful conquest of the Roman empire. Thus, next to the
land itself, the highways of the ancient world have exerted the
most powerful influence upon biblical history, literature, and
religion.</p>

<p><b>Lack of the Road-building Instincts among the Semites.</b>
The Semitic races, as a rule, were not road-builders. Their
earlier nomadic experiences had accustomed them to long and
arduous marches over rough, rocky roads. The ox, the camel,
the horse, and the donkey furnished the common means of
transportation. Most of the people went from place to place
on foot, and in Palestine the distances were so short that this
mode of travel was easy and practical. To-day in well-travelled
roads large boulders lie in the middle of the way, worn smooth
by the hoofs of pack-animals and by the feet of countless passersby,
who through the centuries have stumbled over them rather
than put forth the effort of a few moments in removing them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The Aryans were the first to develop good roads in southwestern
Asia. The royal Persian post-roads, that connected remote
parts of the vast empire, introduced a new era in road-building.
The greatest road-builders of antiquity were the Romans; but
most of the superb highways, which to-day arouse the wonder
and admiration of the traveller, were constructed by them in
the second and third Christian centuries, later, therefore, than
the biblical period.</p>

<p><b>Evidence that Modern Roads Follow the Old Ways.</b>
There is strong evidence that the later roads usually followed
the ancient paths. Both were connecting links between the
same important centres. Both necessarily crossed the same
fords and the same mountain passes. The later roads were
held within the same limits by natural barriers and by that tendency
to follow established traditions which has ever characterized
the East. In riding over the roads of Palestine to-day
the traveller is constantly reminded that he is following in the
footsteps of the early inhabitants of the land. Often the
path, instead of following the most direct course, climbs over a
pass or steep hill, past a rocky ruin once a famous city, but now
a mere chaos of scattered rocks. The road still follows this
awkward détour simply because a thousand years ago it led
to a populous town. Where the roads have changed their
course it has been because the centre of population or of political
ascendancy has changed, or else because the Romans,
disregarding old traditions or physical obstacles, flung their
mighty highways over the mountains and across the deep
valleys.</p>

<p><b>Ordinary Palestinian Roads.</b> The common Hebrew word
for road is <i>derekh</i>, which means literally <i>a trodden path</i>, made
by the feet of men and animals. It well describes a majority of
the roads of Palestine to-day. It suggests to the experienced
Palestinian traveller in most cases a narrow path, so thickly
strewn with rocks that it is to him a never-ceasing wonder that
his horse or mule is able, without mishap, hour after hour to
pick its way over these rough piles of stone. Sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
path runs over a steep mountain hillside, where the animal is
obliged to lift itself and rider by sheer strength up rocky steps
a foot and a half to two feet in height or to hold itself with
marvellous skill on the sloping side of a slippery rock. Often
the horse flounders blindly among scattered boulders while it
braces itself against the rush of a mountain stream. At times
the traveller must balance himself on his horse as it struggles
and often swims through fords whose waters reach almost to
the top of its back.</p>

<p><b>Evidence that the Hebrews Built Roads.</b> There are indications,
however, that road construction was not entirely unknown
to the ancient Hebrews. <i>M[)e]sill[=a]h</i>, another common
Hebrew term for road, means literally <i>that which is heaped
up</i>, that is, <i>a raised way</i>. The common translation, <i>highway</i>,
is exact. In Judges 20:31, 32 there are references to highways
which ran to Bethel and to Gibeah. In I Samuel 6:12 is an incidental
reference to the road which ran from the Philistine city
of Ekron up through the Valley of Sorek toward Jerusalem.
Along this road the ark was sent, drawn on a cart by two cows.
The ancient narrative alludes, however, to the roughness of the
road. From I Kings 12:18 it is clear that in the days of the
united kingdom a highway for chariots ran from Shechem to
Jerusalem. The allusions in II Kings 7 also indicate that in
the later days of the northern kingdom there was a road from
Damascus to Samaria, over which the chariots of the Arameans
passed. As early as the reign of David royal chariots became
common in Israel (<i>e. g.</i>, I Kings 1:5). This fact does not prove
the existence of great highways like those built by the Romans,
for the ancient charioteers were able to drive over roads which
would seem to a westerner utterly impassable; but it does imply
the rude beginnings of road construction, probably under royal
supervision. Apparently the Israelites inherited from the more
highly civilized Canaanites a few well-worn highways and a
certain knowledge of the art of road-making.</p>

<p><b>The Four Roads from Egypt.</b> Four great roads led eastward
from the land of Egypt. The northernmost, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
called "the way of the land of the Philistines" (Ex. 13:17),
issued from the northern end of the Nile delta and passed
north of the marshy Lake Menzaleh. Thence it ran along
within a few miles of the coast of the Mediterranean, through
Raphia to Gaza. There it met the great coast road to the
north and the local roads running through the heart of Palestine.
The second road was called "the way to Shur" (Gen. 16:17, I Sam.
15:7). It seems to have first passed through the present Wady
Tumilat, thence turning northward to the southern end of Lake
Menzaleh, to have run past the Egyptian fortress of Taru,
now Tell Abu Sefeh. Taru may be identical with the word
Shur, which appears in the Hebrew name of this highway.</p>

<p>From this point the road struck almost directly across the
undulating desert to Beersheba and thence along the Wady es-Seba
and the Wady el-Kulil to Hebron. The third highway
led from the eastern end of the Wady Tumilat almost due east
until it crossed the Brook of Egypt. Then one branch turned
northeast past the ancient Rehoboth, to join the second road at
Beersheba. The other branch went on eastward across the
Arabah to Petra and thence across the Arabian Desert to
Babylonia. The fourth road from Egypt also started from
the Wady Tumilat, thence past the Bitter Lakes directly across
the northern end of the Sinaitic peninsula to the ancient Elath,
at the end of the northeastern arm of the Red Sea.</p>

<p><b>Trails into Palestine from the South.</b> Five roads led up
into Palestine from the south. One, "the way of the Red
Sea" (<i>Yam Suph</i>, Nu. 14:25, 21:4, Dt. 1:40), starting from Elath,
ran northwest, until at Aboda it joined the third highway from
Egypt, which ran northeast to Beersheba and Hebron. A second
more arduous and less used trail ran directly north from
Elath through the Arabah to the southwestern end of the Dead
Sea. Thence the traveller might proceed to Jerusalem by a
western détour through El-Fôkâ and Hebron, or else keep along
the shore of the Dead Sea and then turn inland at Engedi.
A third trail led from Elath along the desert to the old Edomite
and later Nabatean capital of Petra. With camels and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sufficient supply of water it was possible thence to cross the
Arabah and the heart of the South Country in a northwesterly
direction to Beersheba.</p>

<p><b>Highway Through Moab.</b> The fourth road ran directly
north from Petra across deep gorges and over rocky roads
through Shôbek, et-Tufileh, Kerak and northward, following a
straight course about eighteen miles to the east of the Dead Sea.
This was the main highway through the heart of Moab. Farther
north it ran past the famous Moabite towns of Dibon and
Medeba. At Heshban, opposite the northern end of the Dead
Sea, a branch turned westward to the lower ford of the Jordan,
while the main road ran north along the eastern side of the Jordan
until it joined the Damascus road south of the Sea of Galilee.
At Heshban another important branch turned to the northeast
and, passing through Rabbath-Ammon, joined the desert
road to Damascus. In later times the Romans, to protect
their east-Jordan border cities, built a magnificent road from
Rabbath-Ammon to Petra, following the ancient highway
through the heart of Moab. Mile-stones, great rock-cuttings,
ruins of stone bridges, and miles of stone pavement still remain
to bear testimony to Rome's strength in the distant provinces
even during the period of the empire's decline.</p>

<p><b>The Great Desert Highway.</b> The chief highway from the
south to the north was the present pilgrim road from Damascus
to Mecca, along which now runs the modern Turkish railway.
This road was the main connecting link between Arabia and
the lands of the eastern Mediterranean. Making a wide détour
westward to touch the port of Elath, it then turned to the northeast
of Petra and ran along the desert highland between thirty
and forty miles to the east of the Jordan and Dead Sea valley.
It crossed the dry, open desert, strewn at many points with
débris of black basaltic rocks. Like most desert roads it
sprawled out over the hot plains, unconfined by fields or mountain
passes. The stations were simply stopping-places for
travellers and traders, for it everywhere avoided the cultivated
land, except where its western branch passed through the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of the Hauran on its way to Damascus. Here it ran close to the
important cities of Edrei, the famous fortress on the upper Yarmuk,
and Ashteroth-Karnaim. A little northeast of Rabbath-Ammon
one branch, deflected to the northeast, and passing
through the desert town of Bozrah, and thence skirting the
eastern side of the lava tract of El-Lejah, reached Damascus.
From Edrei and Bozrah a caravan route ran southeast to the
ancient Duma, the present Dumat el-Jandal, and on to the
oasis of Tema.</p>

<p><b>Character of the Southern Approaches to Palestine.</b>
It is significant that the chief entrances to the west-Jordan
land from the south are not through the South Country but
by the way of Moab. The roads which lead directly into
Judah are deflected by the grim, barren ranges of the South
Country either to Beersheba on the southwest or to the Arabah
on the southeast. The roads themselves lie through a rough,
wild, dry, Bedouin-invested country, over which it is impossible
for large tribes or armies to advance. Of the two east-Jordan
highways, that through the heart of Moab passes over
steep mountains and down into deep wadies, and in ancient
times led through a thickly populated and well-guarded region.
The great and easy highway is along the borders of the desert,
and it was probably by this way that most of the invaders from
the south found their way to the west-Jordan land.</p>

<p><b>The Coast Road.</b> In western Palestine four main highways,
connected by cross-roads, led from the south to northern Syria
and eastward to Assyria and Babylonia. The first was the
direct coast road which connected Egypt with Ph&oelig;nicia and
Asia Minor. Throughout its course it kept close to the sea.
Only in Philistia was it driven inland by the drifting sands.
Along an artificially constructed causeway it rounded the end
of Mount Carmel and proceeded northward along the Plain
of Acre over the difficult cliffs of the Ladder of Tyre to the
plains of Ph&oelig;nicia. Thence it ran along the open way past
Beirut, until it reached the difficult pass of the Dog River.
There the bas-reliefs and inscriptions on the rocks indicate not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
only that from the days of Ramses II the great conquerors of
antiquity had passed along this highway of the nations, but
also that many of them shared in the task of cutting the road
across these difficult cliffs.</p>

<p><b>The "Way of the Sea."</b> The second great northern highway,
the famous Via Maris of the Romans, branching from the
coast road either at Ashdod or Joppa, ran on the eastern side
of the Plain of Sharon, close to the foothills of Samaria. Near
where it was joined by the important road which came down
through the Barley Vale from Shechem and Samaria, this great
highway divided into three branches. One ran to the north
along the eastern and northern side of Mount Carmel and
joined the coast road. Another, apparently the main branch,
turned to the northeast, passed through the Wady Arah, and
emerged upon the Plain of Esdraelon beside the famous old
fortress of Megiddo. From here it ran directly across the
plain, past Mount Tabor through Lubieh and down the steep
decline from the plateau to the northwestern end of the Sea of
Galilee. Owing to the soft, loamy character of the Plain of
Esdraelon, this was often impassable in the winter and spring.
Caravans and armies would then take the third branch from the
Plain of Sharon, which at first ran almost due east over the
Plain of Dothan and past the old Canaanite city of Ibleam.
Thence it crossed the Plain of Esdraelon at Jezreel and joined
the direct road that ran past Mount Tabor to the Sea of Galilee.
From the northwestern end of the Sea of Galilee this much
traveled Way of the Sea ascended the heights to the north and
crossed the Jordan a little below Lake Huleh at the ford now
spanned by the old stone bridge known as the "Bridge of the
Daughters of Jacob." From the Jordan the road followed an
almost straight line northwest, past El-Kuneitra in eastern
Jaulan, across the desert to Damascus.</p>

<p><b>Its Commercial and Strategic Importance.</b> From the
point where it crossed the Jordan a branch of this main highway
went westward through the valley between upper and
lower Galilee, to ancient Accho, the chief seaport of Damascus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Thus across Galilee, with its open roads, poured the commerce
of Damascus and the desert world of which it was the outlet.
From Damascus to Egypt this second great highway of Syria
ran almost entirely over broad deserts or open plains. It was
the main road through the heart of northern Israel, along which
passed not only the merchants, but also the conquering armies
of Babylonia and Assyria.</p>

<p><b>The Central Road and Its Cross-Roads in the South.</b>
The third great northern highway was connected with Egypt
and the south by the way of Beersheba. It followed close to
the watershed of central Judah, along the line of the present
carriage-road from Hebron to Jerusalem. It ran past Bethzur
and Beth-zecharias, famous in Maccabean warfare. From
Bethzur an important highway deflected to the northwest,
following the Wady es-Sur and the eastern side of the Shephelah,
or Lowlands, as far as the Valley of Ajalon on the borders
of the Philistine Plain. From Jerusalem several roads ran
through the valleys to the west and northwest, connecting
with the highways on the Plain of Sharon. Of these the chief
went northwest past Gibeon, down the deep descent of the upper
and lower Beth-horons to Joppa. Another ran still farther to
the northwest to Gophna, to join the second great highway at
Antipatris.</p>

<p><b>In the North.</b> The main highway continued directly north
from Jerusalem to Shechem. Then turning a little to the
northwest it passed through the city of Samaria over the open
plains to Ibleam, where it joined the eastern branch of the
famous Way of the Sea, which led past the northwestern end
of the Sea of Galilee to Damascus. Opposite Mount Gerizim
a branch of the central road turned northeast and ran through
Thebez, Bethshean, and the western side of the Sea of Galilee.
An extension of the central highway ran north over central
Galilee through the valley of Merj Ayun to the great valley
between the Lebanons and Anti-Lebanons. Thence this central
highway continued through Riblah and Hamath, crossing
the upper Euphrates at Carchemish. Turning eastward at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
this point it ran through northern Mesopotamia past Harran
and across the level plains between the Tigris and the Euphrates
to Nineveh and Babylon. It was along this broad
highway that the Assyrian and Babylonian conquerors repeatedly
advanced against Palestine and later carried away
Hebrew captives from both northern and southern Israel.</p>

<p><b>The Road Along the Jordan.</b> The fourth main highway to
the north, starting from Jerusalem, passed northeast through
the barren, picturesque wilderness of Judea to Jericho. Thence
it followed the western side of the Jordan Valley and the Sea of
Galilee to Khan Minyeh, where it joined the other great roads
which led to northern Syria and Damascus. From this fourth
highway many cross-roads led eastward and westward. From
Jericho a western road ran up the Wady Suweinit to Michmash
and thence across southwestern Samaria. Farther north,
three others led up from the Plain of the Jordan to Shechem and
thence by the Barley Vale to the Plain of Sharon. At Bethshean
the road to the north was crossed by another highway, which
ran from Gilead westward across the Plain of Jezreel. Thence
a highway crossed the northwestern side of the Plain of Esdraelon,
reaching the great coast road at Haifa and Accho.
Also from the southwestern end of the Sea of Galilee another
important road ran northwest past the Plain of Asochis to
Accho. From the upper Jordan valley a highway led northeast
past ancient Dan and Banias along the eastern spurs of
Mount Hermon to Damascus.</p>

<p><b>Roads Eastward from Damascus.</b> From Damascus a
great caravan route struck off due east across the northern end
of the Arabian Desert, reaching the Euphrates in the vicinity
of Sippar. Thence it turned southward to Babylon and the
cities of lower Babylonia. Another route, popular in later
times and probably also in use during the Assyrio-Babylonian
period, made a larger circle to the north, touching at Palmyra
and other desert stations. Palestine, and especially the central
plain of Esdraelon, was therefore the focus of the great
highways which connected all points in the ancient world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><b>The Highway from Antioch to Ephesus.</b> The main highway
which skirted the coast of the eastern Mediterranean
crossed the Amanus Mountains through the Syrian Gates a little
north of Antioch. At this point one branch ran northward
to connect with the great trade routes which came from Babylonia
and the East. The main road to the west, however, after
touching at Alexandria (the present Alexandretta) rounded the
eastern end of the Mediterranean, where it was joined by one
of the great trade routes which came from the Euphrates Valley.
After passing through Tarsus, it abruptly turned almost
due north, crossing the Taurus Mountains by the Cilician Pass,
and then with much twisting and winding went westward, following
in general the dividing line between the central plateau
of Asia Minor and the rugged southern mountains. At Kybistra
it forked, the northern branch crossing the plateau directly
to Laodicea. The southern and more commonly used
branch made a long détour through the important cities of
Derbe and Iconium. At Julia to the northwest the great
western highway again parted. One main branch ran in a
southwesterly direction through Apameia, Colossæ, and thence
by the broad and fertile valley of the River Mæander to Ephesus,
the commercial and later the political capital of Asia Minor.
Another straighter but less used highway followed the valley
of the Cayster to Ephesus.</p>

<p><b>The Road from Asia Minor to Rome.</b> The other great
branch of the main highway from Julia westward was the old
overland route to Rome. It ran first due east. Two important
branches came down from Dorylaion in the north, connecting it
with Nicæa and Constantinople. The old overland route continued
eastward through Philadelphia and Sardis. From Sardis
a branch ran straight to Smyrna, the commercial rival of Ephesus.
The main road, however, turned to the northwest from Sardis,
passing through Thyatira, Pergamus, the earlier capital of
Asia Minor, to Troas, from whence the traveller could take
ship directly to Neopolis and Philippi. A highway, however,
passed northward across the Hellespont and thence through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
southern Thrace to Philippi. From this point the great Via
Egnatia led due west through Thessalonica and Pella to Aulonia
and Dyrrachium. From these Adriatic ports a short sea
voyage brought the traveller to Brundisium, whence a well-worn
highway led directly across southern Italy to Rome.
This long and arduous road through southern Europe and
central Asia Minor was the main thoroughfare for travel, trade,
and official communication between Rome and her eastern
provinces.</p>

<p><b>From Ephesus to Rome.</b> Travellers who preferred a
shorter land and a longer water journey took ship from Ephesus
to Corinth. Thence they were transferred across the
isthmus to a ship which skirted the shores of Epirus and landed
them at Brundisium. If they preferred a still longer water
journey, they could take ship at Ephesus around the southern
end of Greece, either to Brundisium or else through the straits
of Messina; thence to Puteoli, or to Ostia, the port of Rome
itself.</p>

<p><b>From Syria to Rome by Sea.</b> Travellers or merchants
making the journey from Palestine wholly by water had before
them the choice of two ways. The most common course
was to take ship at some one of the ports of Syria: Cæsarea,
Accho, Tyre, or Sidon. Thence they skirted the shores of
Syria and Asia Minor to Rhodes, seeking a harbor each night
or whenever the weather was unfavorable. From Rhodes the
ordinary course was to the eastern end of Crete and thence
along its southern shores, where favorable harbors could be
found. From the western end of Crete the ancient mariners
skirted the southern shores of Greece, and then, with the aid
of the northern winds, which came down through the Adriatic,
made their way to the eastern shores of Sicily and thence through
the straits of Messina. From here they sailed to Puteoli or
else to the mouth of the Tiber.</p>

<p><b>From Alexandria to Rome.</b> The second method of reaching
Rome from Syria by sea was by way of Alexandria, which
could be reached either by local ship or by the coast road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
From this great seaport of Egypt, during the Roman period,
fleets of large grain vessels made frequent trips, bearing Egyptian
grain to the capital city. According to the Latin writer,
Vegetius (IV, 39, V, 9) the open season for navigation on the
Mediterranean extended from March tenth to November tenth,
although the favorable season was limited to the four short
months between May twenty-sixth and September fourteenth.
From about the twentieth of July to the end of August the
famous Etesian winds ordinarily blew steadily from the west.
These winds made it possible for the fleets of east-bound merchantmen
to make the trip from Rome to Alexandria in what
seemed to the ancients the marvellously short period of from
twenty to twenty-five days. The west-bound trip, however,
was much more difficult. Owing to the prevailing west winds
the mariners were obliged to cross the Mediterranean to some
point on the southern shores of Asia Minor and thence to run
westward from port to port along the usual route on the southern
side of Crete and Greece.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><b>Significance of the Great Highways.</b> Over these great
highways across and around the eastern Mediterranean the
civilization of the ancient world spread to the ends of the earth.
These were the paths which the Jewish exiles followed in their
western exodus. By the beginning of the Christian era Jewish
colonies and groups of converts to Judaism were to be found
in all the cities touched by these great arteries of commerce.
Along these highways passed the armies and culture of the
West to the conquest of the East, and the ideas and religions of
the East to the conquest of the West. They were thus the
natural bonds that bound together the human race in one
common brotherhood.</p>

<h3>EARLY PALESTINE</h3>


<p><b>The Aim and Value of Historical Geography.</b> Historical
geography deals primarily with the background of history
rather than with the detailed historical facts themselves. It
aims to go back of events and movements and to study underlying
forces and causes. Primitive peoples are more subject
to the influences of physical environment than the more civilized
races. Modern peoples are able with the aid of art and
science to rise superior in many ways to natural conditions and
limitations. A knowledge, therefore, of the physical forces
at work in early Palestinian history is of especial value in reconstructing
this important but little known chapter in the
life of the race.</p>

<p><b>Sources of Information Regarding Early Palestine.</b>
The discoveries of the past quarter century have revealed in a
remarkable way the outlines, at least, of the early history of
the states along the eastern Mediterranean. The meagre biblical
references have been supplemented by the contemporary
testimony of the Babylonian and Egyptian monuments. For
this early period the Babylonian data are still incomplete,
being limited to the statements of certain early conquerors,
such as Lugalzaggisi and Sargon I, that they made expeditions
to the West Country. Beginning, however, with about 1600 B.C.,
the Egyptian records furnish rich and in many cases detailed
pictures of conditions in Syria and Palestine. Thotmose III,
who reigned between 1479 and 1447 <small>B.C.</small>, has given a vivid
account of his many campaigns and conquests in the lands
along the eastern Mediterranean. In his lists inscribed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
great temple at Karnak he gives the names of three hundred
and eighty cities, of which one hundred and nineteen are in
Palestine. From the reign of one of his successors, Amenhotep
IV, the great reforming king of Egypt, comes the famous collection
of the Tell el-Amarna letters. These were found in
ruins which lie on the east side of the Nile about one hundred
and seventy miles south of Cairo. Nearly three hundred
of these tablets, written in the Babylonian language and script,
have been recovered. They represent the correspondence of
Amenhotep IV and his predecessor with the kings of Babylonia,
Assyria, and Mitanni, and especially with the Egyptian
governors of Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Evidence of the Excavations.</b> Recent excavations in Palestine
at the ancient border town of Lachish and at Gezer on
the coast plain, at Taanach and Megeddo on the southwestern
side of the Plain of Esdraelon, and at Jericho in the Jordan
valley, have greatly enriched our knowledge of early Palestine,
for a large majority of the inscriptions and archæological remains
that have been discovered at these sites come from the pre-Hebrew
period. Of these the ruins of Gezer have been most
thoroughly excavated (under the direction of the Palestine Exploration
Fund) and have yielded by far the most detailed and
valuable results. The ancient town lay on the borders of Philistia,
on the line between Judah and northern Israel. It was
built on one of the foot-hills which extend out into the plain beyond
the Valley of Ajalon.<sup><a href="#z61">(61)</a></sup> Thus, while it belonged to the
hill country, it was almost entirely surrounded by the plain
and open to all the influences which affected the Mediterranean
coast cities. The original town rested on two hills, one on the
east and the other on the west, and extended across the shallow
intervening valley. Four or five distinct cities, built successively
one upon another, have been unearthed.</p>

<p><b>The Oldest Inhabitants of Palestine.</b> The remains found
in the lowest stratum of the mound of Gezer introduce us to the
earliest inhabitants of Palestine. They probably belonged to
the Neolithic Age and to a non-Semitic race. From the skeletons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
thus far discovered it is clear that they were short in
stature, averaging between five feet four inches and five feet
seven inches in height. Already they had begun to cultivate
the ground and to make rude flint implements. They kept
cows, pigs, sheep, and goats. In certain caves, coming from
this or an earlier age, rude attempts to picture these animals
have also been discovered. Their pottery was shaped by hand
and decorated with red or white lines. Their ancient town was
surrounded by an earthen wall, ten feet thick, faced on the inside
and out with stone. Gezer was evidently selected as the site
of an ancient city because about it are many caves, the original
dwelling-places of these primitive people. They apparently
worshipped underground deities, in connection with sacred
caves. Outside the entrance to such a cave at Gezer are found
eighty or more cuplike cavities sunk in the rock and probably
used for purposes of sacrifice.</p>

<p><b>The Semitic Invasions From the Desert.</b> Situated, as
was Canaan, on the borders of the desert, it was practically
inevitable that in time great waves of nomadic invaders would
sweep in through the broad valleys and down the coast plains.
In the light of the excavations at Gezer and the testimony of
the Egyptian inscriptions, this was precisely what occurred
somewhere between 2500 and 2000 <small>B.C.</small> Undoubtedly the
Semites had begun to find their way to Palestine before this
period, but it is clear in the light of recent discoveries that this
great movement from the desert toward the eastern shores of
the Mediterranean antedated by several centuries another similar
movement eastward, which carried from Syria or northern
Arabia to Babylon the founders of its first dynasty. In the
light of the latest discoveries, the rule of this dynasty must be
dated between 2100 and 1700 <small>B.C.</small> The excavations at Gezer
reveal the presence there at this period of a Semitic race from
five feet seven inches to five feet eleven inches in height, sturdier
than the preceding aborigines and possessed of relatively high
civilization. The city was surrounded by a wall about ten
feet thick, made of large hammer-trimmed stones, and guarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
by towers at intervals of ninety feet. The approach on the
south was through a huge gateway nine feet wide, forty-two
feet long, and flanked by two towers, which were faced by sunburnt
bricks. Bronze and copper implements are found and
there are abundant evidences of an advanced culture.</p>

<p><b>Influence of the Early Amorite Civilization Upon Babylon.</b>
The recent work entitled <i>Amurru</i>, by Professor Clay of Yale,
has raised anew the question of what was the centre of the oldest
Semitic civilization. The attempt made by certain scholars to
prove the Babylonian origin of all that is distinctive in the
civilization, traditions, and religion of the early Semitic nations
including Israel is extreme. The evidence adduced by Professor
Clay to prove that in the earliest period Syria influenced
Babylonia more than the Tigris-Euphrates valley influenced
the westland is cumulative. Many of the familiar Babylonian
traditions bear marks that suggest a western origin. Over one-tenth
of the names in the large literature that comes from the
reign of Hammurabi, the great king of the First Babylonian
dynasty, are Amorite or western Semitic. The names and attributes
of most of the Babylonian gods are best explained on the
basis of a western origin. The Babylonian custom of rearing
ziggurats or high places for their deities, even on the level plains
of Babylonia, seems to reflect the western custom of worshipping
the gods on the high places. Furthermore, Syria is pre-eminently
the home of the sun worship that was especially
prominent in the Babylonian cults.</p>

<p><b>The Probable Site of the Oldest Semitic Civilization.</b>
The many references to the Amorites in early Egyptian and Hebrew
history indicates that they developed an ancient and high
civilization. The original centre of their power appears to
have been central Syria, and especially the broad, fertile plains
between the Lebanons and the Anti-Lebanons, through which
flowed the upper waters of the River Orontes. It is certain
that from a geographical point of view conditions were here
supremely favorable for an early and powerful civilization.
The climate was warm and yet stimulating, the soil rich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
easily cultivated. The lofty mountains on either side afforded
natural protection, and yet did not ward off frequent thrusts
that came from the Arab invaders that pressed in, like the ancestors
of the Amorites, from the adjoining desert. Communication
was also easy in every direction. Through this great
plain ran the main highways of trade from north to south and
east and west. Ample opportunity was offered for expansion
on every side. The later appearance of the Amorites in Palestine
and at other places along the eastern Mediterranean coastland
is also best explained if the earliest home of their civilization
was central Syria.</p>

<p><b>Remains of the Old Amorite Civilization.</b> Large mounds,
evidently the remains of ancient Amorite cities, dot the broad
plain between the Lebanons. These have as yet been untouched
by the spade of the excavator. They alone can tell the
age, character, and history of the old Amorite civilization.
They furnish the most promising field for excavations in all the
Semitic world. On the neighboring mountain heights exquisite
sun temples still remain. Although they may have been reared
by the later Ph&oelig;nicians they doubtless stand on the sites of
older Amorite sanctuaries. As of old, the sun, as it rises and
sends its first rays through a lofty mountain pass, shines through
the open door of the temple and lights up the altar within.
The ruins of the great temple at Baalbek, which stand in the
middle of the plain between the Lebanons, are still one of the
wonders of the world.<sup><a href="#z62">(62)</a></sup> Although this vast temple was built
late in the Roman period, it testifies to the rich productivity
of the broad valley in which it lies and to the religious traditions
that clung to this favored region.</p>

<p><b>Babylonian Influence in Palestine.</b> Even though the
origin of the earliest Semitic culture in the Tigris-Euphrates
valley may, in the light of future excavations, be traced back
to Syria, there is no doubt that from the days of Hammurabi,
about 1900 <small>B.C.</small>, Babylon exerted a powerful influence upon
Syria and Palestine. The frequent references in the literature
that comes from the reign of Hammurabi to the Amorite merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and immigrants show how close were the relations
between the westland and the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Hammurabi,
in a recently discovered inscription, also calls himself
"the king of the Amurru." The Babylonian language and
method of writing was used in Palestine as late as the fourteenth
century B.C. by the Egyptian governors of Syria and Palestine
even in communicating with the kings of Egypt. Practically
all of the pre-Hebrew literature thus far discovered in the mounds
of Palestine was written in Babylonian characters. These facts
are irrefutable evidence of the strength and duration of the influence
that the highly developed civilization of Babylon in the
five centuries after Hammurabi exerted upon the West Country.</p>

<p><b>Egyptian Influence in the Cities of the Plain.</b> Thus far
the results of the excavations in Palestine have revealed a preponderating
Egyptian influence. At Gezer scarabs from the
Twelfth Egyptian dynasty (between 2000 and 1788 <small>B.C.</small>) have
been discovered. The method of burial here employed was
identical with that of Egypt at the same period. The excavations
at ancient Lachish and Taanach also indicate that along
the coast plains and inland valleys which led from these plains,
Egypt's influence was paramount. This condition is precisely
what would be anticipated from the relative position of Egypt
and Palestine. Two or three great open highways led around
the southeastern end of the Mediterranean, binding these two
countries closely together. Egypt, by virtue of its fertility and
favorable physical conditions, developed a much higher and
earlier civilization than did Palestine. Hence it was inevitable
that these western and central cities of Palestine would sooner
or later take on the complexion of the earlier civilization.</p>

<p><b>Different Types of Civilization in Palestine.</b> The excavations
in the old Canaanite city of Jericho, in contrast to
those on the borders of the Philistine Plain, have disclosed only a
few indications of Egyptian influence there at this early period.
Evidently the natural barriers which separated the different
parts of Palestine from each other were asserting themselves,
with the result that the life and civilization of the various cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
throughout the land already presented wide variations. Along
the coast were strong Semitic cities, surrounded by thick walls
and possessed of all that the mingled culture of ancient Amurru,
Babylonia, and Egypt could give. Traces of the influence of
Mycenæan and Ægean civilization are also found in the strata
which come from this early period. In the north the Ph&oelig;nician
cities were approaching the zenith of their power. Up among
the hills of the central plateau, however, the Shashu, or Bedouin,
still pastured their flocks undisturbed, except near the large
cities, where they were probably obliged to pay tribute.</p>

<p><b>Conditions Leading to the Hyksos Invasion of Egypt.</b>
About 1700 <small>B.C.</small> there came a marked change in the political
situation in southwestern Asia. In Babylon the Kassites came
down from the mountains to the northeast and conquered the
valleys of the lower Tigris and Euphrates. About the same
time Assyria asserted its independence and began to lay the
foundations for its future greatness. Somewhat later an Aryan
race, known as the Mitanni, descended from the north, seized the
plains of Mesopotamia, and established there a strong kingdom.
This new kingdom, as well as the weakness of Babylon itself,
delivered Palestine from eastern invasions. Egypt was also
torn by civil wars and dissensions between the nobles. Under
these favoring conditions the Semitic peoples of Palestine,
Syria, and probably also of Arabia, united for the invasion of
Egypt.</p>

<p><b>Fortunes of the Invaders.</b> The Egyptian records unfortunately
give little information concerning this so-called Hyksos
invasion. The fact, however, is established that northern
Egypt, for about a century, until the earlier part of the sixteenth
century <small>B.C.</small>, was held by Asiatic conquerors bearing
Semitic names. When finally expelled from Egypt by the
Theban kings in the south, these foreign conquerors retired to
Palestine and Syria. Thither they were pursued by the energetic
warrior kings who arose at this critical period in Egypt's
history. At first the Hyksos leaders made their stand at Sharuhen,
a city probably situated somewhere in southern Judah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Later the Egyptian kings conquered the cities of Palestine, and
finally, after a prolonged struggle, succeeded in capturing the
powerful city of Kadesh on the Orontes, which was apparently
the centre of the confederacy of Syrian states.</p>

<p><b>The One Natural Site in Syria for a Great Empire.</b> The
history of the Hyksos invaders by analogy throws light upon
the older Amorite kingdom, of which it was perhaps a later revival,
and demonstrates that the broad valley between the Lebanons
and the Anti-Lebanons, of which Kadesh was the centre,
was practically the only region in Syria fitted to become the
seat of a strong civilization and a large empire. Entrenched
among these northern plains and protecting mountain ranges,
it was possible for an energetic people to extend their sway over
practically all the coast lands of the eastern Mediterranean.
Naturally, when a favorable opportunity offered for the conquest
of Egypt, it would be eagerly improved; for the rich valley
of the Nile has always been a tempting prey to outside peoples.
The history of the later Hittite kingdom, the southern capital of
which was also at Kadesh, illustrates the same principle. A
still later and even more familiar analogy is the career of the
Seleucidean kingdom, whose capital was at Antioch, a little
farther north. Thus the only four kingdoms in the history of
the eastern Mediterranean that conquered this entire territory
and aspired to wider conquest sprang up, not in Palestine, but
amidst the more favorable conditions in central Syria.</p>

<p><b>Influence of the Land Upon the Early Forms of Worship.</b>
The peculiar physical conditions of Palestine not only shaped
to a great extent its early history, but also made a profound
impression upon the religion of its inhabitants. The limestone
rock of Palestine was especially favorable to the formation of
caves. These caverns and passages in the rocks were not
only the homes of the earliest inhabitants, but were also closely
identified with the oldest forms of religious worship. Beneath
the earlier sanctuaries at Gezer and Taanach were caves, clearly
connected with the primitive cult which once flourished there.
Probably the gods here worshipped were subterranean deities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The prominence of the oracle in the early religions of Palestine
may well be due to the ease with which a designing priesthood
could deceive a credulous people by the skilful use of these
subterranean chambers. The most striking features in the
landscape of Palestine were the high peaks, the jagged rocks,
the springs bursting from the hillside, and the green trees standing
out in striking contrast to their gray, sombre background.
Each of these occupied a prominent place in the early Canaanite
religions. On the heights, commanding wide views over valley
and plain, were reared the high places, or ancient rock-cut
altars.<sup><a href="#z52">(52,</a> <a href="#z53">53)</a></sup> Scores of these are still to be found among the
rocky hills of Palestine. Certain rocks were regarded as sacred
because it was believed that in them the deity dwelt. These
sacred rock-pillars, or maççebôth, as they were called by the
Hebrews, were found near every ancient Canaanite altar and
even, as at Taanach, before the entrance to private houses.
A row of nine such pillars has been discovered standing in the
temple court at Gezer. At Taanach there was a double row.
The most impressive examples are the two huge monoliths
which guard the ascent to the famous high place at Petra. Frequently
these sacred stones or pillars are worn smooth by the
lips of worshippers or by the libations which have been poured
upon them. Often there are cuttings on the top or side, where
sacrifices were probably offered to the numen or deity, who
was supposed to reside within. Beside or beneath each ancient
sanctuary, as at Gezer and Taanach, was a spring or well, which
apparently figured in the worship. Beside these ancient sanctuaries
grew trees, symbols of life and the mystery of generation.
Sometimes these trees were represented by the asherahs or sacred
poles to which the Hebrew prophets often referred.</p>

<p><b>Upon the Beliefs of Its Inhabitants.</b> More fundamental
still was the impression which the diverse physical contour of
Palestine made upon the beliefs of its ancient inhabitants.
Where the contour of the land made political unity impossible
there were necessarily many independent races and kingdoms,
each worshipping their patron god or goddess. Hence the religions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of Palestine were grossly polytheistic and the worship
of one common God was a goal which the people would never
have attained except under a strong compelling influence from
without. The different cults of Palestine were also deeply
influenced by the character of the land amidst which they developed.
The deities of the Canaanites living on the fertile
plains were either gods of fertility or else represented the mysterious
principle of generation. Their worship naturally became
voluptuous and licentious. The grim hills of central Palestine
and the dark volcanic gorge of the Jordan and Dead Sea engendered
a cruel and relentless type of religion and worship in
which human sacrifice was an important feature. Thus, although
the foundations of a nobler type of culture were being
laid, the political and religious history of Palestine during this
earlier period gave little promise of the supremely important

<h3>PALESTINE UNDER THE RULE OF EGYPT</h3>


<p><b>Reasons Why Egypt Conquered Palestine.</b> The Egyptian
rule in Palestine was established about 1580 <small>B.C.</small> and, with the
exception of two long lapses, was maintained for nearly three
centuries. Thotmose III, the greatest warrior and organizer
in Egyptian history, after fifteen energetically fought campaigns,
extended the border of Egypt to the Euphrates and brought
all the petty little rival kingdoms in Palestine and Syria under
his control. The reason for his intense activity was not merely
the lust for conquest and spoil, but the desire to deliver Egypt
from the danger of another attack similar to that of the Hyksos.
From a very early period the northeastern boundary of Egypt
was guarded by fortresses, since there were no natural barriers
between it and Palestine. The population of northern Arabia
was too scattered to be a menace to the peace of Egypt; but
Palestine and Syria, with their fertile fields and growing population,
were a just cause of anxiety and fear to the peace-loving
dwellers of the Nile valley. The powerful kingdoms on the
Tigris and Euphrates were also from the earliest times ever
eager for western conquest. Thus with the sixteenth century
B.C. began the great struggle between the East and the West for
the possession of Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Commanding Position of Megiddo.</b> Throughout the
Egyptian period the city of Megiddo, on the southwestern side
of the Plain of Esdraelon, overshadowed all others in importance.
Here the united kings of Syria and Palestine made their stand
against Thotmose III, and after capturing this mighty fortress,
the Egyptian ruler was left master of Palestine. The reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
why Megiddo had attained this prestige was partially because of
its strategic importance and partially because of its military
strength. Recent excavations leave little doubt that this
famous Canaanite city is to be identified with the present Tell el-Mutesellim<sup><a href="#z63">(63)</a></sup>.
It is one of the three or four most imposing
mounds in all Palestine. It lies close to the Samaritan hills and
yet stands out in the plain, a huge, round plateau between fifty
and seventy-five feet in height. It commands a view of practically
every part of the Plain of Esdraelon and far along the Plain of
Jezreel toward the Jordan until the view is cut off by Mount
Gilboa. It looks straight across the Plain of Esdraelon at its
broadest point, through the valleys which lead past Mount
Tabor to the Sea of Galilee. A little to the left rise the hills
of Lower Galilee, while to the northwest it commands the view
through the narrow pass to the Plain of Acre and the Mediterranean.
Under its northeastern front ran the important road
leading northwest from the Jordan and central Palestine and
connecting with the main highway along the northern coast.
On its southeastern side, through a broad, fertile valley, came
the main highway from the southern coast plains and Egypt,
which ran northeastward to Damascus. A northern branch
passed through the wide plain between the Lebanons and the
Anti-Lebanons.</p>

<p><b>Its Military Strength.</b> The city is to-day a stately, deserted
ruin, but its sides are so steep on the east and west that it is still
impossible for even the hardy Arabian horses to mount to the
top from these directions. For one on foot, accustomed to
climbing, it is an exceedingly difficult scramble. A low saddle
of land connects the mound with the Samaritan hills to the
west, making the approach from this point somewhat easier.
Recent excavations have further revealed the great strength of
this fortress city. It was surrounded by a wall twenty-eight
feet thick and guarded by towers of corresponding strength.
On its level top was an area of several acres, ample room for a
large Canaanite population, for the houses were little more than
cubicles, and the streets narrow, intricate lanes, at many points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
scarcely wide enough for two people to pass comfortably. The
public buildings, however, which included a palace and temple,
were of a much stronger and more massive construction.<sup><a href="#z64">(64)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Thotmose III's Advance Against Megiddo.</b> Standing upon
the mound of Megiddo it is not difficult to picture the great
decisive battle, which the scribes of Thotmose III have recorded
vividly and with great detail. His courage in rejecting
the counsels of his generals to advance from the Plain of
Sharon by a détour and his resolve to approach the city directly
through the valley from the southwest command our admiration,
for five miles to the south the valley narrows, affording a
splendid opportunity for a determined enemy to attack an invading
army with great advantage. Without opposition, however,
the Egyptian army, with its gay oriental trappings, came
up the valley. Its energetic king was in front, "showing the
way by his own footsteps." Having reached the Plain of
Esdraelon at the south of Megiddo, the king, late the same
afternoon or in the night, threw out his left wing on the hills
to the northwest of the city that he might command the roads
leading along the western side of the Plain of Esdraelon.
He thus both secured his line of retreat and was in a position
to cut off fugitives in case he won the decisive battle. This
position also gave him the easiest line of approach to Megiddo
itself.</p>

<p><b>The Decisive Battle.</b> The following morning the king
rallied his forces for battle. While his left wing retained its
strategic position his right wing was drawn up on a hill to the
southwest of the city. He was thus able to descend upon the
forces of the allied Canaanite kings, who were drawn up in a
north and south line before the city. Riding in a glittering
chariot of elektrum, the indomitable warrior led the onset.
Before this army, already a victor on many hard-fought battle-fields,
the Canaanites at the first attack fled headlong to Megiddo.
Finding the gates closed against them, many of the fugitives
were drawn up the wall by their friends within. Elated by their
easily won victory and attracted by the rich spoils in the camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of the vanquished king of Kadesh, the victors fell to plundering
and thereby lost a precious opportunity to capture the city at
once.</p>

<p><b>Capture of Megiddo.</b> Not daunted by its seemingly impregnable
walls, Thotmose III at once gave orders to surround
it. His servants he sent out to gather the ripening grain on the
fields which stretched across the Plain of Esdraelon and to collect
the great herds that were pasturing over the grass-covered
hills and valleys on its border. Within the city no provision
had been made for a siege, and the thousands shut up within
its walls were soon reduced to starvation. After several weeks,
the city was, therefore, compelled to surrender. The king of
Kadesh had fled, but his family and the families of his nobles
fell into the hands of the conqueror. The spoils found in the
captured city reveals the almost incredible opulence of this
early Canaanite civilization. Nine hundred and twenty-four
chariots, two thousand two hundred and thirty-eight horses,
two hundred suits of armor, the royal tent, with the sceptre of
the king of Kadesh, an ebony statue of himself, inlaid with
lapis-lazuli and gold, a silver statue, probably of some god, and
vast quantities of gold and silver were among the spoils which the
conqueror claims to have found in the captured city.</p>

<p><b>The Cities of Palestine.</b> The contemporary literature already
discovered indicates that by 1400 <small>B.C.</small> most of the cities that
figured in Hebrew history were already established and that
Palestine was almost, if not fully, as densely populated as in the
days of the Hebrews. Among the chief Ph&oelig;nician cities on the
coast were Arvad in the north, Byblos and Beirut in central
Syria, and Sidon, Tyre, and Accho in the south. The coast
plains to the south of Mount Carmel, including the cities of
Dor, Gezer, Ashdod, Altaku, Askalon, Gath, and Gaza, were at
this period held by the Ph&oelig;nicians or their kinsmen the Canaanites.
Among the cities later captured by the Hebrews were
Kadesh and Hanathon in Galilee, and Shechem, Bethel, Beth-horon,
Ajalon, Jerusalem, and Beth-anoth in southern Palestine.
As in the days of the Hebrew occupation, the Plain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Esdraelon was the centre of a strong Canaanite confederacy,
which included Megiddo, Taanach, Shunem, Bethshean, and
certain other cities whose sites have not yet been identified.</p>

<p><b>Disastrous Effects of Egyptian Rule.</b> The Egyptian rule
of Palestine put a stop for a time to the wars between the petty
city states and brought them all into close contact with the life
and culture of Egypt. But the fertile Nile valley, with its
warm climate and luxurious atmosphere, was not a land to produce
a great colonizing or organizing power. Egypt, because of
its shut in position, was always selfish and provincial. None
of the Egyptian rulers of Palestine sought to develop the interests
and resources of the native peoples or to unite them under
a common government. Their sole interest in Palestine was to
protect themselves from the danger of invasion from that quarter
and to extract the largest possible tribute from its inhabitants.
Egypt willingly left the native chiefs of Palestine in control as
long as they paid tribute and did not rebel, for the sharp contrast
between the soft, equable climate of the Nile valley and the
winter cold of the eastern Mediterranean coast lands made
residence there exceedingly distasteful to the Egyptians. The
few resident Egyptians were officials, whose chief duties
were to collect the tribute and to report conditions to their
king. Apparently the Pharaohs never attempted to establish
a standing army in Palestine or Syria; but to maintain their
rule they depended upon the rivalry of the local princes and
upon intimidating the natives by campaigns characterized by
the greatest severity and cruelty in the treatment of rebels.
Thus Egypt took the wealth and life blood of Palestine and
gave almost nothing in return.</p>

<p><b>Lack of Union in Palestine.</b> On the other hand, the topography
of Palestine was such that it furnished no basis for a
broad patriotism that would unite all the petty kingdoms and
races in its narrow bounds. This inability successfully to combine
against the common foe, and the broad valleys that opened
into central and northern Palestine from the south and west,
made its conquest by an Egyptian army very easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><b>Exposure to Invasions From the Desert.</b> Another marked
characteristic of Palestine is the key to the understanding of
the next stage in its history. As has been noted before, "it
lay broadside on to the desert." As surely as air rushes into
a vacuum, so the tribes from the desert steppes irresistibly
surged into Palestine through its eastern gateways the moment
its internal strength was relaxed. The selfish, intermittent,
destructive rule of Egypt not only repeatedly decimated the
population of Palestine but weakened its outposts. In time
they even goaded on the native princes to call in the Bedouin
tribes to aid them in throwing off the conqueror's heavy yoke.</p>

<p><b>Advance of the Habiri.</b> The Tell el Amarna letters and
those discovered in Palestine reveal precisely this state of
affairs. It was under the rule of Amenhotep IV, who was
more intent upon religious reforms than on the ruling of his
distant provinces, that Egyptian control of Palestine was first
relaxed. A stream of letters poured in upon the king from the
governors of the cities of Palestine, telling of each other's
treachery and of the advance of bands of the Habiri, who at
this time, about 1360 <small>B.C.</small>, poured into Palestine from the
desert. These new invaders possess a unique interest for the
student of biblical history, for among them in all probability
were Aramean as well as Arabian tribes, the ancestors of the
later Hebrews. They seem to have been independent tribes
under the leadership of their chiefs. They succeeded in capturing
many of the weaker outlying cities. Often they were employed
as mercenaries by the rival princes of Canaan, and
they readily allied themselves with the native peoples in an
endeavor to throw off the yoke of Egypt. The governors of
such important cities as Megiddo, Askalon, and Gezer wrote
beseeching the Pharaoh to send troops to aid them against these
strong invaders. In the ruins of Taanach is found an interesting
letter, sent to the governor of the town by an officer at
Megiddo. It reads: "To Istar-washur from Aman-hashir.
May Adad preserve thy life! Send thy brothers with their
chariots, and send a horse, thy tribute, and presents, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
prisoners who are with thee; send them to Megiddo by to-morrow."
In the ruins of Lachish was found a similar letter,
written in Babylonian by its governor Zimrida, and stating that
unless an Egyptian army was sent quickly the city must submit
to the invaders. Jerusalem, under its governor, Abdhiba, was
one of the last cities to resist the advance of the Habiri. At
last, however, these people from the desert prevailed. An
Egyptian officer, writing of the native peoples, states: "They
have been destroyed, their towns laid waste.... Their countries
are starving, they live like goats of the mountain."</p>

<p><b>Rise of the Hittite Power.</b> This chapter in the history of
early Palestine throws much light upon later Hebrew history.
The invaders evidently soon coalesced with the older Canaanite
inhabitants, infusing new blood and energy into the people;
but they quickly adopted the older civilization. The conditions
of Palestine remained practically the same as in the days
before the Egyptian invasions. The geographical characteristics
of the land reasserted themselves. The old rivalries and wars
between the little states of Palestine quickly sprang up again, so
that, when the energetic kings of the Nineteenth Egyptian
Dynasty appeared, the land was once more ripe for conquest.
Meantime, however, the Hittites, profiting by the more favorable
physical conditions in northern Syria, had come down
from Cappadocia and the mountains of eastern Asia Minor
and had built up a strong kingdom, having for its southern
capital Kadesh on the Orontes. From this centre they had
extended their influence not only over Syria, but also over
Palestine. When Ramses II, the great ruler of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, set out in 1288 <small>B.C.</small> to conquer the eastern Mediterranean
coast lands, he found himself, like Thotmose III, two
hundred years before, confronted by a powerful foe, strongly
intrenched in the broad valleys between the Lebanons. After
an undecisive battle and many campaigns Ramses was glad to
establish with this rival power a treaty which left the Hittites
in possession of northern Syria and the Egyptians masters of
Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><b>Palestine Between 1270 and 1170 B.C.</b> The period of
half a century which immediately followed was one of peace
and prosperity for Palestine. Ramses II and his son, Merneptah,
kept the great empire intact by their indomitable
energy and efficient organization. With the passing of the
Nineteenth Dynasty there came a period of anarchy in which
the Egyptian rule of Palestine was for a time relaxed. Ramses
III, the great ruler of the Twentieth Dynasty, set about restoring
the former bounds of the empire. For over a quarter of
a century (1198-1167 <small>B.C.</small>) he succeeded in holding Palestine
and in inflicting severe blows upon the Hittite power in the
north; but his reign marked the end of Egypt's greatness.
The Valley of the Nile was never fitted by nature to be the centre
of a great world power. Its foreign conquests had been largely
the result of the energy and personal ability of four or five
great Pharaohs. Syria and Palestine, because of their central
position, felt the effect of all the great world movements, not
only in the south and east, but also in the west. During the
beginning of the twelfth century <small>B.C.</small> there was a great upheaval
among the Aryan peoples living along the northern coast lands
of the Mediterranean. As a result, they were obliged to seek
homes elsewhere and so came streaming down the coast of Syria
in thousands both by land and by sea. They overran Syria and
broke forever the power of the Hittites along the eastern Mediterranean.
Hordes of them pressed into the Nile Delta, and
were turned back only by the strong armies and activity of
Ramses III. One branch, the Peleset, of the Egyptian inscriptions,
overthrew the old Canaanite population and settled
at this time on the coast plains south of Joppa. They were
known in Hebrew history as the Philistines.</p>

<p><b>The Epoch-Making Twelfth Century.</b> It was also during
this transitional twelfth century that the cumbersome Babylonian
language and system of writing ceased to be used in
Palestine. Instead, a consonantal alphabet, derived by the
Ph&oelig;nicians from the Egyptians and also possibly in part from
the Babylonians, came into use. The same alphabet, transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
through the Ionian Greeks, became the basis of the
one now in vogue throughout Europe and the western world.
This same Ph&oelig;nician alphabet was used by the later Hebrew
priests, prophets, and sages in conveying their immortal messages
to the world. Thus the twelfth century B.C. inaugurated
a new and significant era in the intellectual as well as the
political history of mankind.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<h3>THE NOMADIC AND EGYPTIAN PERIOD OF
HEBREW HISTORY</h3>


<p><b>The Entrance of the Forefathers of the Hebrews Into
Canaan.</b> The biblical traditions regarding the beginnings of
Hebrew history differ widely in regard to details, but regarding
the great movements they are in perfect agreement. They
all unite in declaring that the forefathers of the race were nomads
and entered Palestine from the east. The fourteenth chapter
of Genesis contains later echoes of a tradition which connects
Abraham, the forefather of the race, with the far-away glorious
age of Hammurabi (Amraphel) who lived about 1900 <small>B.C.</small> Interpreted
into historic terms, this narrative implies that the Hebrews
traced back their ancestry to the great movement of
nomads toward Palestine which took place about the beginning
of the second millennium <small>B.C.</small> It was about this time that the
earlier non-Semitic population in Palestine was supplanted
by the Semitic races, known to later generations as the Canaanites.
In tracing their ancestry to these early immigrants, the
Hebrews were entirely justified, for the mixed race, which ultimately
occupied central Palestine and was known as the Israelites,
in time completely absorbed the old Amorite and Canaanite
population. The Jacob traditions point to a later movement of
nomadic peoples toward Palestine. In the light of the contemporary
history of Canaan it is exceedingly probable that
this is to be identified with the incoming wave of the Habiri,
among whom were undoubtedly to be found many of the early
ancestors of the Hebrews. These successive waves of nomadic
invasion were the inevitable result of the physical conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
already considered and were a part of that prolonged mixing
of races which has gone on in Palestine through thousands of
years and which contributed much to the virility and enduring
power of the Israelites.</p>

<p><b>References to the Israelites During the Egyptian Period.</b>
The references to the Habiri in the Tell el-Amarna letters and in
the inscriptions found in the mounds in Palestine imply that
the majority of the Habiri either conquered the older Canaanite
population or else coalesced with them and thus found permanent
homes in the land. This infusion of new blood was,
in fact, an inevitable consequence of Egypt's cruel, destructive
policy in the treatment of Palestine. Seti I and Ramses II,
of the Nineteenth Egyptian Dynasty, in the record of their
campaigns in Palestine, refer to a state called Asaru or Aseru
in western Galilee. This was the region occupied by the
Hebrew tribe of Asshur and would seem to indicate that by
1300 <small>B.C.</small>, half a century after the invasion of the Habiri, this
tribe was already firmly established in the land of Canaan.
Merneptah, the son of Ramses II, refers to Israel in a connection
which leaves no reasonable doubt that a people bearing
this name were to be found in his day in Palestine. This is
the earliest and only reference to Israel thus far found on the
monuments prior to the ninth century <small>B.C.</small> That many if not a
majority of the ancestors of the later Hebrews were already
established in Palestine by the beginning of the thirteenth
century <small>B.C.</small> must now be regarded as a practically established
fact.</p>

<p><b>The Habiri in Eastern and Central Palestine.</b> The
bounds of Palestine were narrow and the ancient population
numerous. Some of the Habiri appear to have found homes
in the east-Jordan land, where they gradually acquired the
habits of agriculturists and reappear in later history as the
Moabites and Ammonites. Naturally, some of these invaders
retained their flocks and herds and nomadic mode of life. This
was possible because of the peculiar character of Palestine.
In the uplands of the central plateau, and especially in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
south, the traveller still frequently comes upon the flocks and
black tents of the Bedouin. According to the earliest biblical
narratives it was here that certain of the Hebrew tribes remained
for a generation or more, with their flocks and tents, tolerated
by the city dwellers who cultivated the plains even as are the
Bedouin by the inhabitants of Palestine to-day.</p>

<p><b>The Trend Toward Egypt.</b> The Hebrew narratives imply
that some of these tribes lived in the South Country of Judah,
beside the great highways which led to Egypt. The early
Egyptian records contain frequent references to the movements
of Semitic nomads from southwestern Asia toward the Valley
of the Nile. In the tomb at Beni-Hassan there is a picture of
thirty-seven Semitic warriors being received by a local Egyptian
ruler. To-day, at certain seasons of the year, the visitor at Cairo
may find encamped on the eastern side of the city hundreds of
Bedouin, who after months of wandering in the Arabian desert
find the banks of the Nile a desired haven of rest. All the highways
from southern, eastern, and northeastern Arabia, as well
as from Palestine, converge at the Wady Tumilat, the natural
gateway of Egypt. When the pressure of population increased
in Palestine and Egyptian rule was re-established, as it was by
1280 <small>B.C.</small>, the nomadic ancestors of the Hebrews sought homes
elsewhere. For them a change of abode to the attractive
pasture land along the eastern delta of the Nile was easy. The
biblical narratives state that they also went at the invitation of
their powerful kinsman, Joseph.</p>

<p><b>The Land of Goshen.</b> According to the oldest Hebrew
records, the part of Egypt in which the Hebrews settled was
the land of Goshen. The word has not yet been found on the
Egyptian monuments, but there is little doubt regarding its
general situation. In its broadest bounds, it apparently included
the Wady Tumilat, and extended from the Crocodile
Lake, the modern Lake Timsah, to the Pelusiac or the Tanitic
branch of the Nile. It was a narrow strip of land thirty or forty
miles long. On the west, where the Wady Tumilat opened into
the Nile Delta, it broadened into an irregular triangle. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
angles were at the modern cities of Zigazig, in the northwest,
Belbeis in the south, and Abu Hammâd at the beginning of the
valley on the east. By many scholars this triangle is regarded
as the original land of Goshen. Until the days of Ramses II
the entire region, including the Wady Tumilat, was given up
to the shepherds. Here, therefore, the Israelites could keep their
flocks and maintain their tribal unity and practical independence.</p>

<p><b>The Wady Tumilat.</b> The Wady Tumilat is a low-lying,
shallow valley bounded on either side by the hot, rocky desert.
In ancient times it was dry except when its narrow bed was
occasionally flooded by the inundations of the Nile. On the
west it opened into the Nile Delta. At an early period the
Egyptians had established at the eastern part of the Wady
Tumilat a fortress (known as the "Wall of the Prince"), for it
was the most vulnerable spot on all the Egyptian frontier.
Amidst these more favoring conditions on the borders of the
Nile Delta it was inevitable that nomads, possessed of virile
physiques, but hitherto restricted by lack of food and water,
would rapidly multiply. The modern East presents many
analogies. The alarm which, according to the biblical narrative,
this increase aroused in the minds of the Egyptians is in perfect
keeping with the fear with which the dwellers of the Nile
always regarded the Bedouin.</p>

<p><b>Ramses II's Policy.</b> The great change in the fortunes of
the Hebrews was in all probability the result of the policy of
Ramses II. To carry out his ambitious building enterprises
it was necessary for him to enlist the services of vast bodies of
workmen. Into this service he naturally pressed the foreigners
resident in or on the borders of Egypt. In order to connect
Egypt more closely with its Palestinian provinces, and above
all to develop its resources to the full, this famous organizer conceived
and carried through the plan of converting the eastern
Nile Delta and the Wady Tumilat into tillable land. To
this end he probably repaired and enlarged the canal that had
been constructed as early as the days of the Twelfth Dynasty.
It was about fifteen yards in width and sixteen to seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and a half feet in depth, and ran eastward from the Nile Delta
through the Wady Tumilat into the Crocodile Lake. According
to Pliny, it was sixty-three miles in length. It is paralleled
to-day throughout most of its course by the fresh-water canal,
which irrigates this region and supplies the towns on the Suez
Canal with drinking water. The ancient canal was constructed
primarily for navigation, but it was also essential in reclaiming
the land on either side.</p>

<p><b>Building the Store-Cities of Ramses and Pithom.</b> To
effect the transformation of this region, Ramses II built two
important cities. One of them bore his name and became the
designation of the surrounding territory, which was known as
the country of Ramses. It probably stood at the western
end of the Wady Tumilat. The other, the Pithom<sup><a href="#z65">(65)</a></sup> of the
biblical records, has been proved in the light of modern excavation
to have been the ancient P-atum, that is, the House of the
God Atum. This city was situated near the eastern end of the
Wady Tumilat, at the present Tell el-Maskhutah, ten or twelve
miles west of Lake Timsah. This was probably also the site
of the older fortress known as the "Wall of the Prince." Several
inscriptions have been found here containing the name P-atum.
In later Egyptian geographical lists this was also the name of
a local province. Here Naville discovered what appear to have
been great store chambers with walls two or three yards in
thickness, made of crude, sun-dried bricks. These chambers
were not connected and the grain was put into them through
openings in the top. Here, apparently, Ramses II gathered the
vast supplies of grain necessary for his Palestinian campaigns,
for these cities were built during the earlier, warlike period of
his reign.</p>

<p><b>Condition of the Hebrew Serfs.</b> In the light of the well-established
facts of Egyptian history and of the geographical
background, it is easy to appreciate the condition of the nomadic
Israelites. Their pasture lands were transformed into cultivated
fields and occupied by Egyptian colonists. The sons of the
desert, ever restive under the restraints of civil authority, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
put at forced labor and compelled to build the border fortresses
which made their bondage the more hopeless. Palestine was
in the control of their royal Egyptian task-master. The wilderness
that stretched almost from their doors far out into the
wild, rocky desert, offered the one possible place of escape; but
under the iron rule of Ramses II and his successor, Merneptah,
the escape of large bodies of fugitives was practically impossible.</p>

<p><b>Training of Moses.</b> The one Hebrew, however, who dared
raise his hand against the oppression of the Pharaoh, succeeded
in escaping beyond the border fortresses and found a home
among the nomadic kinsmen of his race in the rugged mountains
that lie between southern Judah and the Sinaitic peninsula.
Here, amidst the dangers and solitudes of the desert,
Moses, the great prophet, leader, and founder of the Hebrew
nation, received his training. Here he learned to trust the
Power that guides the destinies of men and nations, and to
despise the boasted strength of Egypt. In guiding the flocks
of Jethro, his father-in-law, through the trackless wilderness filled
with wild beasts and hostile Bedouin, he had also become
skilled in leading men.</p>

<p><b>The Historical Facts Underlying the Plague Stories.</b>
Moses' work in leading the Hebrews from Egypt is a familiar
chapter in biblical history. In the break-down of the Egyptian
government and in the period of anarchy which followed the
fall of the Nineteenth Dynasty, a supremely favorable opportunity
was offered for the escape of the serfs. An Egyptian
writer states that at this time "the Egyptians had no chief
ruler for many years. The land of Egypt was in the hands of
the nobles and rulers of towns; each slew his neighbor, great
and small." A certain Syrian also proclaimed himself king
and made the entire land tributary to him, plundering the people.
To these evils were added the horrors of foreign invasion.
Even under a good government the sanitary conditions in Egypt
are far from satisfactory. In the time of anarchy and bloodshed
the hot valley of the Nile is ravaged by disease and plagues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The seven plagues described in the oldest biblical narrative
were not miracles, but the natural catastrophes which, from
time to time, have afflicted the land of Egypt. Most of them
are characteristic of the Nile Valley and can only be fully understood
in the light of its physical and climatic peculiarities.
Certain of these plagues also stand in a close casual relation to
each other, as well as to the historical events recorded by the
contemporary Egyptian historians. Foreign invasion and civil
war, with the attendant slaughter, would inevitably lead to the
contamination of the waters of the Nile. Upon this one river
depended the health and life of the inhabitants of Egypt. Unsanitary
conditions and the defilement of the waters would
breed frogs and flies. The flies would in turn spread abroad
the germs of the disease which attacked the flocks. Hail and
swarms of locusts are exceedingly rare in Egypt, but they are
not unknown, as careful observers have attested, and their
rarity would make their appearance all the more impressive.
The identification of these remarkable plagues with the anger
of the god or gods was accepted by the Egyptian as well as by
the biblical writers.</p>

<p><b>Method of Travel in the Desert.</b> The peculiar topography
of the territory of eastern Egypt, which was the scene of the exodus,
throws much light upon the historic event which lies back
of the different biblical narratives. As in the account of the
plagues, the later versions, which unfortunately are the most
familiar, have magnified the miraculous element. The older
version, however, is clearly the one which should be followed.
Apparently the scattered Hebrew tribes were rallied and later
guided in their marches by the means still employed by the
caravans through the same wastes of sand and rock. A brazier
of coals is carried before the leader of the caravan to show where
he is and the direction of the march, so that those who straggle
sometimes many miles behind will not be lost in the wilderness.
By day there rises from these coals a column of smoke which,
in the clear atmosphere of the desert, may be seen many miles
away. By night the glowing coals are lifted aloft so that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
may be guided by their light. In this manner the Hebrews
were reminded of Jehovah's presence and guided by his prophet,
Moses.</p>

<p><b>Moses' Equipment as a Leader.</b> The distance from the
eastern side of the land of Goshen to the wilderness was only
a few miles. What the Hebrew serfs most needed was a courageous,
energetic, and trained leader, able to command their
confidence and inspire them to quick and decided action.
These qualities Moses had acquired largely as a result of his
desert experience. Above all, he was able to appeal to their
faith in the God of their fathers, and thus, like the great prophet
of Islam, to rule his followers through their religious as well
as through their selfish impulses.</p>

<p><b>The Scene of the Exodus.</b> Of the two ways which led eastward
from Egypt, the Israelites chose the southern, that ran
directly into the desert. The northern route, the Way of the
Philistines, was already guarded by strong, warlike peoples.
Unfortunately, the oldest biblical account of the exodus contains
no geographical data, and none of the three or four places
mentioned in the late priestly narrative have been identified.
The interpretation which places the scene of the exodus near
the present port of Suez, at the northern end of the western
arm of the Red Sea, is based wholly on the biblical reference to
the Sea of Reeds, which is commonly translated Red Sea.
That this term is frequently used in the Old Testament as the
designation of the Red Sea is unquestioned; but there is no
place in the vicinity of the present Port of Suez which satisfies
the conditions implied by the biblical narrative. Furthermore,
it is difficult to see what would have led the Hebrews to make
this long and difficult détour to the south rather than escape to
the desert directly east of the Wady Tumilat. The biblical narrative
implies that the latter was the course followed. The
significant term, Sea of Reeds, points not to the Red Sea, in
whose saline waters reeds would not thrive, but to the marshy
shores of the Crocodile Lake, the modern Lake Timsah, which
lay directly east of the Wady Tumilat. Into it poured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
fresh waters from the Nile, which were conducted thither by
the canal that ran along the wady. Even though the modern
Suez Canal, which runs through it, has transformed conditions,
Lake Timsah is still surrounded by a thicket of vegetation.
Inasmuch as the Hebrews frequently used the word sea (for
example, the Sea of Galilee) as the designation of an inland
lake, the name Sea of Reeds was exceedingly appropriate.</p>

<p><b>Probability That the Passage Was at Lake Timsah.</b> According
to the earliest biblical narrative deliverance came to
the Hebrews as they were pursued by the Egyptians because
"Jehovah caused the sea to go back, by a strong east wind all
the night, and made the bed of the sea dry." The shallow southeastern
end of Lake Timsah satisfies most fully the physical
conditions implied by this ancient narrative. At its southern
end it opens out into a broad bay, but between this point and
the main body of the lake was a shallow, marshy strait, not more
than a quarter of a mile across. A strong wind driving it from
the level desert would force back the waters into other parts of
the lake, leaving this passage comparatively dry. A close and
significant parallel is recorded by Major-General Tulloch,
who states that the shallow waters of Lake Menzaleh, which
lies only a short distance to the north and is subject to the same
conditions, were driven back by the wind for seven miles, leaving
the bottom of the lake dry (<i>Journal of the Victorian Institute</i>,
vol. XXVIII, p. 267, and vol. XXVI, p. 12). The biblical
narrative also states that "Jehovah bound the chariot wheels
of the Egyptians so that they proceeded with difficulty." This
is precisely what would follow, not on a hard, sandy shore, but
in the marshy, muddy depths of a body of fresh water like Lake
Timsah. While the exact scene of that incident, which, more
than any other in their history, impressed upon the consciousness
of the Israelites Jehovah's power and willingness to deliver
them, will never be exactly identified, the southeastern end
of Lake Timsah is the most probable site.</p>

<h3>THE HEBREWS IN THE WILDERNESS AND EAST OF
THE JORDAN</h3>


<p><b>Identification of Mount Sinai.</b> Desert sites are so readily
forgotten, and the records of this period in Israel's history were
committed to writing so many years after the events transpired,
that it is now impossible to follow the Israelites with certainty
in their desert wanderings. Their first aim after leaving Egypt
was to find a safe asylum. In this quest the experiences of
their leader, Moses, would influence them to find at least a temporary
refuge with his kinsmen, the Midianites. Their second
aim was to worship at the sacred mountain the God who had
so signally revealed himself to them. According to the Northern
Israelitish traditions (Ex. 3:1) the mountain of God was near
the wilderness, where Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro,
his father-in-law. In all the biblical narratives it is implied that
Sinai was not far from the land of Midian and that the home
of the Midianites was to the south or east of Mount Seir. All
the earliest references in the Old Testament, as for example,
Judges 5:4, 5 and Deut. 33:2, indicate definitely that Mount Sinai
was at least near the Mount Seir range, if not identical with
one of its peaks.<sup><a href="#z66">(66)</a></sup> Furthermore, recent excavations have
shown that the road which led along the western arm of the
Red Sea to the Mount Sinai of later tradition passed important
Egyptian garrisons, stationed there to guard the extensive
quarries and mines which for centuries had been worked under
the direction of the Pharaohs. This route would also have
taken the Israelites far away from their kinsmen and their ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
goal, into a barren country, incapable of supporting a
large body of men and filled with hostile Arab tribes.</p>

<p><b>Lateness of the Traditional Identification.</b> The tradition
which identifies the mountain of God with Jebel Mûsa,
in the southern part of the Sinaitic peninsula,<sup><a href="#z67">(67)</a></sup> cannot be
traced earlier than the fourth or fifth centuries of the Christian
era. The detailed itinerary of Numbers 33 is generally recognized
to be one of the latest sections in the Old Testament and
embodies the late Jewish conception of the wilderness period.
All attempts to identify the sites here mentioned have proved
uniformly unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><b>Probable Route of the Hebrews.</b> Of the two or three
sites mentioned in the biblical narrative, Elim, with its twelve
springs of water and seventy palm-trees, is probably the fertile
spot at the end of the northeastern arm of the Red Sea known
in later biblical times as the port of Elath. A journey of two
hundred miles along the main caravan route from Egypt
would bring the Hebrews to this point after three weeks comfortable
travel. From there the highways branch northward
toward Canaan. If Sinai was their first objective point, the
earliest biblical references to this mountain indicate that from
Elim they probably turned to the northeast and followed the
way of the Arabah until they reached that one of the many
peaks in the southwestern part of the Mount Seir range which
was regarded by their Midianite kinsmen as the special abode
of Jehovah. Here Moses' Midianite father-in-law visited the
Israelites. Here, in keeping with an ancient custom of the
desert, a sacred covenant was made with their God, which
became the basis of their later social and religious life.</p>

<p><b>Kadesh-barnea.</b> Late Jewish (<i>cf.</i> Jos. <i>Ant.</i> IV, 4:7) and
modern Moslem traditions make the picturesque Wady Mûsa,
in the heart of which was the marvellous Edomite capital,
Petra, the scene of their desert sojourn; but the older biblical
narratives indicate that from Sinai the Hebrews turned to the
northwest. A desert journey of sixty or seventy-five miles
would bring them into the midst of the series of bold, rugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
mountains, cut in every direction by dry wadies, known to-day
as the Jebel el-Magrah, in the southwestern part of the South
Country. In one of these wadies was the famous spring of
Kadesh-barnea, still known as Ain Kdês, the Holy Spring.
The water gushes out through several openings from the side
of a steep limestone cliff and is caught in a series of artificially
constructed basins. The stream which arises from this spring,
as it runs down the valley, converts it into what seems in contrast
to its barren surroundings a little oasis. As in the case
of most desert streams, the waters soon disappear, however,
beneath the desert sand. Here, in the heart of the wilderness,
and yet only a few miles east of the point where the highway
that ran from Elath to Beersheba was joined by another
which came across the desert from Egypt, the Israelites apparently
established their central camp.</p>

<p><b>Effect of the Wilderness Life Upon the Hebrews.</b> The
spring of Kadesh is still a favorite resort of Arab tribes, but
its waters are not sufficient to support permanently even a small
Bedouin clan. It is only as the tribes wander from place to
place, ever seeking new pastures for their flocks, that the inhabitants
of this southern wilderness are able to subsist. If
the Israelites remained in this region for a generation, as the
later traditions state, they must have reverted to that nomadic
life which still survives in the desert.<sup><a href="#z68">(68-</a><a href="#z71">71)</a></sup> This experience
was not without value to a race which must work out its destiny
in the face of great obstacles. It taught them to endure want
and hardship. The presence of constant danger not only
developed courage and skill in warfare, but also bound them
closely together. At any moment they were subject to attack
from hostile tribes. Their life and that of their families and
flocks depended upon their finding from time to time springs
of water and pasture lands among the rocky wastes that would
supply the necessities for their strenuous existence. The
constant deep sense of dependence developed those religious
impulses which are very strong in the heart of the Semites.
The long marches through the sombre wilderness by day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
by night fostered habits of meditation and kept ever before their
vision the God who revealed himself through the striking phenomena
of nature. The sense of racial unity which bound
together the Hebrew clans tended to develop the belief, not in
many, but in one tribal God, who had delivered them from
the land of Egypt, who was protecting them from ever-present
dangers, and who was leading them on to the realization of their
destiny. Their nomadic life, with its constant change from
place to place, gave little opportunity for the growth of local
shrines and institutions. As a result, their worship was freed
from those elaborate forms and ceremonies which in more
settled communities took the place of true religion. Thus
during those desert wanderings, under the leadership of Moses,
an ethical religion was born into the world that laid stress not
merely on ritual, but on righteousness.</p>

<p><b>Evidence That the Hebrews Aimed to Enter Canaan
From the South.</b> In the scanty and somewhat confused biblical
traditions regarding the life of the Hebrews in the wilderness
there are clear indications that at first their intention was
to enter Canaan from the south. Their camp at Kadesh, in
the South Country, was doubtless chosen as a base from which
to advance into Palestine, for it was near one of the main highways
which led into the land from the south. Their battle
with the Amalekites, recorded in Exodus 17:8-16, is further evidence
that their ultimate goal was Canaan, for the Amalekites
were Bedouin tribes living in the wilderness on the southern
borders of Palestine. According to the isolated passage, found
in Numbers 21:1 and evidently taken from a very early source,
certain Hebrew clans at least were found fighting with the
Canaanites, who dwelt in the city of Arad, about nineteen
miles south of Hebron. They were defeated, however, some
were taken captive, and probably the rest were driven back
into the wilderness. The story of the spies in Numbers 13
and 14 is, on the whole, the clearest proof of the ambitions
of the Hebrews. From Kadesh a picked group of men were
sent along the great highway past Rehoboth and Beersheba to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Hebron and southern Canaan to investigate conditions, with a
view to conquest.</p>

<p><b>Reasons Why They Did Not Succeed.</b> The report of the
spies makes it clear why the Hebrews, as a whole, did not enter
Canaan from the south. Their statements are in perfect
accord with the conditions revealed by contemporary Egyptian
inscriptions and the results of recent excavations. Already
the territory of southern Canaan was fully occupied. The
larger cities were surrounded by strong walls and their inhabitants
were in possession of the most advanced equipment for
military defence known to that age. These defences were
practically impregnable against the attack of nomadic tribes.
Furthermore, the natural line of approach for the invasion
of Canaan was not through the South Country. Its barren
wastes did not supply a sufficient base from which to make
an attack. The conquest of a land like Canaan by nomads
required a comparatively fertile intermediate territory, where
the besiegers might settle and derive the supplies necessary for
a siege that might last many years. The reasons, therefore,
why a majority of the tribes abandoned their original purpose
to enter Canaan from the south and chose the more
favorable route through the east-Jordan land are obvious and
valid.</p>

<p><b>Tribes That Probably Entered Canaan From the South.</b>
There are intimations, however, that certain desert tribes, later
absorbed into the Hebrew empire, found their way into Palestine
from the south. Caleb, who figures in the story of the
spies as an advocate of advance from the south, appears in the
narrative of the first chapter of Judges as a tribe established
on the southern borders of Judah. It is probable, therefore,
that the Calebites gradually advanced through the South
Country to the possession of the territory which they ultimately
occupied. The same is true of certain Midianite clans, like the
Kenizzites, who shared with Israel the worship of Jehovah, the
God of Sinai. Possibly even before the exodus, certain of these
clans had gained a footing on the borders of Canaan; at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
rate they, together with the Jerahmeelites, are later found firmly
intrenched to the southeast of Judah.</p>

<p><b>The Journey to the East of the Jordan.</b> The account of
the march of the Hebrews from Kadesh to the east of the
Jordan is in perfect harmony with the peculiar topography of
this region. The shortest way was across the dry valley of the
Arabah, past the southeastern end of the Dead Sea and northward
through central Moab; but this involved a journey through
a part of the wilderness which can be made by large bodies of
men only when they are provided with camels and are able to
carry full supplies for the journey. For women and children,
such a journey was exceedingly difficult even if they were inured
to the life of the wilderness. Still more dangerous was the march
of a large tribe through the centre of Moab, for its highways
were difficult and strongly guarded. A second way, which,
according to biblical narrative, the Hebrews seriously considered,
was the narrow, rocky road which led through the heart of
Edom to the great eastern desert highway. Without the consent
of the Edomites, a passage by this easily defended way
was absolutely impossible. Inasmuch as the request of the
Hebrews was refused by the Edomite king, the only way that
remained was the long détour around the southern end of
Mount Seir. Accordingly, they retraced their way southeastward
to Elath. Thence they turned abruptly to the northeast
and took the broad highway northward along the borders of the
desert, where the streams of pilgrims pass to-day on the journey
from Damascus to Mecca (<i>cf.</i> p. 77). The way was through
hot, rocky deserts and it is not strange that the Israelites indulged
in bitter complaints.</p>

<p><b>Stations on the Way.</b> The earliest Old Testament narrative
has preserved a list of the stations on the highway by which
the Israelites approached Moab. Most of these, as the names
indicate, were but stopping-places in the desert, corresponding
probably to the stations on the modern pilgrims' road. Thus
the name Beeroth Bene-jaakan means Wells of the Sons of
Jaakan, and was probably named after the Arab tribe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
roamed in this desert region. The second station from this
point, Jotbathah, is described as a land of flowing brooks. This
is an excellent description of the modern important city of
Maan, near the station on the Damascus-Mecca railway, from
which the traveller to-day sets out for Petra, that lies about
twenty-five miles due west. Maan is a little oasis made by a
beautiful flowing brook, which soon loses itself, however, in
the sands of the encircling desert. It is almost the only spot
along this dry highway from the north to the south where the
weary traveller hears the refreshing ripple of flowing waters.
Farther north the road passes over the high, parched plateaus
where, according to the ancient song in Numbers 21:17, 18, the
Hebrew chieftains joined in digging, or more probably in cleaning
out the well from which the much-needed water might be
secured. The third station farther north bears the name
Nahaliel, which means Torrent Valley of God. It was apparently
at this point that the Israelites turned westward, following
perhaps the ravine which leads from the east to the
great valley of the Arnon. Bamoth, the next station, which
means high places, was probably some height to the north of
the ravine, possibly the Jebel er-Ram (the High Mountain).
The fragment of the ancient poem found in Numbers 21:14, 15,
reflects the profound impression which the deep valleys of the
Arnon made upon the Hebrew invaders. Waheb, in Suphah,
was possibly a place in the Wady es-Sufeiy, which opens into
the Arnon from the east and thus would lie in the line of Israel's
approach. The city of Ar, mentioned in the same connection,
possibly represents the shortened form of the well-known city
of Aroer, on the heights to the north of the Arnon.</p>

<p><b>Conquests East of the Dead Sea.</b> From the banks of the
Arnon, which marked the northern boundary of Moab, the Hebrews
set out for the conquest of the Amorite kingdom of Sihon
to the north. The decisive battle was fought in the open, near
the city of Jahaz, on the borders of the wilderness. The site
of the city has not yet been identified. According to the Moabite
stone (lines 18-20) it was the head-quarters of the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Israelites in their war with King Mesha of Moab. Later
it was captured by the Moabite king and joined to the city of
Dibon, which lay a little north of the Arnon. Eusebius, in his
<i>Onomasticon</i> (264-294), places it between Medeba and Dibon.
This battle gave the Hebrews possession of the upland pastures
and fertile fields lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Heshbon.</b> Sihon's capital, Heshbon, became
the capital of the first Israelite state. It crowned the top of
a low rocky hill, which rose gradually from the rolling plains.
On the east the plains extend unbroken to the desert with
its fringe of purple mountains. It lay, therefore, in the midst
of one of the most fruitful regions in the east-Jordan land and
commanded the wide plains which extended in every direction.
The city itself did not possess great natural strength. Its inhabitants
were obliged to depend upon walls for defence. At
present its top is strewn for acres with ruins of small ancient
houses and what were once an ancient fortress and temple; but
there are no traces of a great encircling wall. The water supply
apparently came from the large pools in the shallow valley to
the east. The city was, therefore, ill-fitted to stand a protracted
siege. This fact probably explains why the ancient Amorite
king chose to meet his foe farther south. The city is two
thousand eight hundred and sixty-six feet above the sea-level
and commands a wonderful view of the blue Gilead mountains
in the north, the gorge of the Jordan to the southwest, the
central plateau of Canaan on the west, and Medeba, set on a
slightly elevated hill across the rolling plains, to the south.</p>

<p><b>Sojourn of the Hebrews East of the Jordan.</b> Heshbon
was the key to the east-Jordan land. Through it ran the central
highway from Moab northward. Westward the road led
rapidly down to the Jordan Valley, past Abu Shittim, the
Meadow of the Acacias, to the main fords opposite Jericho.
At Heshbon and on these high uplands of the east-Jordan the
Hebrews had ever before them the land of Canaan and the open
road inviting them to enter. According to the oldest biblical
narratives, the tribes of Machir and Manasseh also won for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
themselves homes in Gilead, in the rich territory between the
Jabbok and the Yarmuk. A later narrative states that even
at this early period the Israelites crossed the Yarmuk and conquered
the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, whose capital was
the strange, rock-cut city of Edrei in the valley of the upper
Yarmuk.</p>

<p><b>Its Significance.</b> This east-Jordan land supplied in fullest
measure the training and opportunity for expansion which
the Israelites required before they entered upon the larger task
of conquering the lands across the river. Here they learned to
cultivate the soil as well as to follow the flocks. The survivors
of the conquered Amorites began to instruct them in the arts
of agriculture and in the secrets of that higher civilization which
had been developing for centuries in Palestine. Here, amidst
these highly favoring conditions, their numbers rapidly increased,
until they began to feel the need of new fields for colonization.
At the same time they were constantly subject to the pressure of
Arab invasion, which kept sweeping in from the eastern desert.
Meantime the armies of Egypt had been withdrawn and the old
feuds and wars between the different races of Palestine had
sprung up. No strong power had come to the front in northern
Syria. By 1150 <small>B.C.</small> Palestine was ready to receive the race
for which it had been preparing through the long ages.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>THE SETTLEMENT IN CANAAN</h3>


<p><b>The Approach to the Jordan.</b> About the middle of the
twelfth century B.C. the Hebrew tribes from Egypt crossed the
Jordan into Canaan. They probably approached the river
by the main highway which to-day skirts the northern side of
Mount Nebo,<sup><a href="#z72">(72)</a></sup> crossing the Wady Heshban, and entering the
Jordan Valley where the Wady Kefrein broadens into the
meadow on which still stands a group of acacias, the Valley of
Shittim (Acacias), of the Hebrew narratives. After the late
spring and summer freshets the lower Jordan may be forded
at two points. One is at the shallow place where the Wady
Kelt pours its waters and mud into the Jordan. The other is
six or seven miles farther north, just below the point where the
Wady Nimrin comes down from the highlands of Gilead.
Probably the Hebrews crossed by this northern ford.</p>

<p><b>Crossing the Jordan.</b> The older biblical account of the
crossing states that it took place in the time of harvest, when the
Jordan was overflowing its banks. The statement which
follows is unintelligible except as it is explained by the unique
characteristics of this strange river: "Its waters rose up in a
heap, a great way off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan,
and those that went down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the
Salt Sea, were wholly cut off" (Josh. 3:16b). Like the Missouri
River in America, the Jordan frequently changes its course. At
certain points higher up the river, especially where the Samaritan
hills come down close to its shores and the Jabbok pours in its
waters from the east, the river sometimes undermines the clay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
banks, with the result that it is temporarily dammed up, leaving
the bed below comparatively dry. The name of the town
Adam, where its waters "rose up in a heap," means <i>red earth</i>.
It is probably represented by the Tell ed-Damieh which stands
near the famous Damieh ford, just below the point where the
Jabbok enters the Jordan. A reliable Moslem historian records
that in the year 1257 <small>A.D.</small> the Sultan Bibers found it necessary
to send workmen to repair the foundation of the bridge (Jisr
Damieh) at this point, in order to save the retreating Moslem
army. The task seemed impossible because of the spring
floods, which were then on; but to their amazement, when they
arrived at the bridge the men found the river-bed empty. By
working rapidly they were able to complete the repairs before
the waters again rushed down. Naturally they regarded this
remarkable phenomenon as a special divine interposition,
although the historian does not fail to state that the immediate
cause was a huge landslide a little farther up the river. This
later analogy certainly throws much light upon the great event,
which like the exodus, made a profound impression upon the
faith of the Hebrews.</p>

<p><b>Strategic Importance of Jericho.</b> Six miles across the
white terraces that rise from the bed of the Jordan close to the
foot-hills of the western plateau, which here projects far out
into the valley, lay the ancient Canaanite town of Jericho.<sup><a href="#z72">(72)</a></sup>
It stood on an eminence a few feet above the level of the plain.
The old city is to-day but a deserted egg-shaped mound about
one thousand one hundred feet long and five hundred wide,
with three smaller mounds on the top. The total area of the
ruin is about twelve acres. The average height of the mound
is about forty feet above the plain. Immediately below it to
the east is the 'Ain es-Sultan, known in Hebrew times as the
fountain of Elisha. To the south the Valley of Achor, through
which runs the perennial stream of the Kelt, comes down from
the heights of southern Samaria. Immediately back of the
ancient city ran the road over the heights past Michmash and
Ai to join the central northern highway through Judea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Samaria. Jericho, therefore, not only commanded the two
southern fords of the Jordan, but was also the key to the highways,
which led to northern and southern Israel. Before it
stretched broad, rich fields, which could be easily irrigated by
the streams which came down from the western hills.</p>

<p><b>Results of Recent Excavations.</b> Recent excavations have
disclosed the extent and strength of this old Canaanite city.
Long stretches of the ancient wall<sup><a href="#z73">(73)</a></sup> have been laid bare, both
in the northern and southern ends of the mound. This wall is
remarkably well-preserved and of excellent workmanship.<sup><a href="#z74">(74)</a></sup>
On the native rock was first placed a filling of loam and rock
and on this was built a wall of rubble, sixteen feet high and six
to eight feet thick, bulging outward. The spaces between the
stones, which were very large at the bottom, were carefully
filled with smaller stones. On top of this foundation wall was
a supplemental wall of burnt brick, six or seven feet in thickness,
averaging even now in its ruined condition about eight feet in
height. As a result, the city was practically impregnable. At
the northern end of the mound was a citadel, made of unburnt
bricks, three stories high, with a stone staircase leading
to the top. It takes little imagination to picture the imposing
character of this old Canaanite city, small in area, but guarded
by walls from twenty-five to thirty-five feet in height and of a
thickness that surpassed those of many a mediæval fortress.</p>

<p><b>Capture of Jericho.</b> These excavations both confirm and
supplement the biblical account of the conquest of Jericho. The
walls are better preserved than those of any other Canaanite
city thus far uncovered, indicating, as the oldest Hebrew narrative
implies, that the city was captured by stratagem rather
than by siege, or as the later tradition suggests as the result of
a miracle. The story of the spies in the first chapter of Joshua
shows that the Hebrews had friends within the city itself. The
probabilities are that, while they were marching around the
Canaanite stronghold and thus distracting the attention of its
defenders, at a preconcerted signal the gates were suddenly
opened and the Hebrews rushed in and captured the city. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
character of the ruins suggest that the old Canaanite city was
abandoned for several centuries and that the top of the mound
was cultivated, thus confirming the statement of the biblical
historian that the city was entirely destroyed. Later a small
Israelite town, dating from about 700 <small>B.C.</small>, was built on the southeastern
side of the mound. This may represent the rebuilding
of the city in the days of Ahab, as recorded in I Kings 16:34.</p>

<p><b>Evidence That the Hebrews Were Still Nomads.</b> This
complete destruction of Jericho after its capture by the Hebrews
is significant. The city was the natural key to the west-Jordan
country and therefore its chief defence against invaders from
the east. Their abandonment of this outpost indicates that the
Hebrews were still nomads, simply intent upon seizing the upland
valleys, where they could pasture their flocks, rather than
agriculturists, ready to settle down on the plains and able to
perfect the conquest of the land.</p>

<p><b>Roads Leading Westward from Jericho.</b> From Jericho
three main roads led up to the central plateau of Palestine.
The one followed a ridge directly west from Jericho,<sup><a href="#z75">(75)</a></sup> running
at first a little north of the deep, narrow, rocky channel of the
Wady Kelt.<sup><a href="#z25">(25)</a></sup> The second road led up over the steep, barren,
waterless wilderness of Judea, through difficult passes to Jerusalem.
It offered many obstacles and no attractions to the invaders.
A third road turned to the southwest, leaving the
Jordan valley opposite the northern end of the Dead Sea, crossing
the deep gorge of the Kidron in the vicinity of the present
Greek convent of Mar Saba. Thence it ran directly on through
Bethlehem to join the great central highway southward to
Hebron.</p>

<p><b>Conquests in the South.</b> This rocky trail may well have
been the route followed by the tribes of Judah and Simeon,
when, according to the ancient narrative in the first chapter of
Judges, they went up to the conquest of Canaan. Apparently
they did not attempt to capture the stronghold of Jerusalem,
which remained in the hands of the Jebusites until the days of
David. The town of Bezek, which they first conquered, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not yet been identified. It would naturally be looked for at
Bethlehem or at the stronghold of Bethzur farther south. The
text is clearly corrupt and possibly the original reading contains
the name of one or the other of these southern cities. The most
important acquisition of the Judahites was the city of Hebron
in the south. This ancient town lay in a shallow valley and was
protected by no natural defences.<sup><a href="#z76">(76)</a></sup> Allying themselves with
certain Arab tribes, they extended their conquests far out into
the borders of the South Country. The situation of Debir is
still in doubt. It is usually identified with Dhaheriyeh, southwest
of Hebron, where the hills of Judah descend to the wild
South Country. In its vicinity are certain springs, which correspond
to those assigned to one of the clans of the Calebites.
To the southeast, with the aid of the Kenites, the Judahites
succeeded in conquering the border fortress of Arad, seventeen
miles southeast of Hebron. It stood at the head of the Wady
Seyal, which runs up in the direction of the Dead Sea past the
later fortress of Masada. Here dwelt the semi-nomadic Kenites.
The Simeonites, with the aid of the Judahites, also captured the
city of Hormah, far out in the South Country, and in this wild
region, in closer touch with the tribes of the desert than with
the Hebrew tribes of the north, they lived their free, nomadic
life.</p>

<p><b>Conquest of Ai and Bethel.</b> The strong tribes of Ephraim
and Manasseh, under the leadership of Joshua, took the more
direct western road over the heights above Jericho. While at
this period the true home of the Canaanites was still on the
plains, certain of them, or else the descendants of later immigrants,
had already ascended these heights and built small upland
villages. The soil was not sufficiently rich to support a
large population. Probably the inhabitants still depended to a
great extent upon their flocks for sustenance. At the head of
the upland valley, along which the road ran, was the village of
Ai, sufficiently strong to repulse the initial attacks of the Hebrews.
It was finally captured, however, by means of strategy,
in which the wily sons of the desert were adept. In the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
way they captured the sacred city of Bethel, which is generally
identified with the present Beitin,<sup><a href="#z77">(77)</a></sup> two or three miles to the
northwest of Ai. The ruins on this site are so meagre that its
identification is by no means certain. If they represent the
ancient city, it was always insignificant&mdash;a place of pilgrimage
rather than of residence. The present village lies on a gradually
sloping hill, strewn with large limestone rocks. It lacks the
commanding view characteristic of the other high places of
Palestine. Its outcrop of rock furnished abundant sites for
ancient altars and for the rocky pillow on which, according to
Hebrew tradition, rested the head of the fugitive Jacob. It is
important strategically, because near it converge the ancient
roads from the east, the north, and the south. It was captured
by a sudden attack which caught the inhabitants unprepared.</p>

<p><b>Incompleteness of the Initial Conquest.</b> It is probable
that certain other small villages in the uplands near Ai and
Bethel, were captured by the Hebrew tribes that turned northward.
The later traditions record an important battle near
Gibeon, which swept westward down through the pass of the
Upper and Lower Beth-horons. The older narrative, however,
found in the first chapter of Judges, states very definitely that
the Hebrews did not capture any of the important cities on the
plain except Jericho and that all the important towns in central
Canaan still remained in the possession of the older inhabitants.
One zone of strong cities, beginning with Gezer on the west,
including Shaalbim, Ajalon, Gibeon, and Jerusalem, remained
in possession of the Canaanites. Farther north, beginning with
Dor on the Mediterranean coast, another line of strong Canaanite
cities extended across the Plain of Esdraelon to the Jordan,
including Megiddo, Taanach, Ibleam, and Bethshean. These
cities commanded all the important highways from north to
south. Still farther north the chief cities of Galilee were still held
by the Canaanites. Thus, in the early stages of the settlement
in Canaan, the Hebrews, who at this time came in from
the east-Jordan land, succeeded in intrenching themselves only
at two points: (1) in the heights of Judah, from whence they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
gradually extended their conquests, first to the south and then
to the north; and (2) in the highlands of southern Samaria,
gradually spreading down the western hills and pressing northward
through the valleys of Samaria and Galilee. In the north
they readily affiliated with their kinsmen who, like the Asherites,
had probably remained in the land since the first invasion in
the days of Amenhotep IV.</p>

<p><b>Migration of the Danites.</b> The eighteenth and nineteenth
chapters of Judges contain an exceedingly old and vivid picture
of the way in which the different tribes individually won their
homes in this land, where there was no political unity and where
each tribe and city fought its own battles single-handed. At
first the little tribe of the Danites had settled at a point where
the Valley of Sorek penetrated the Judean hills on the west and
opened out into a diamond-shaped valley. Here the Danites
were pressed by the Judahites on the south, the Ephraimites
and Benjamites on the north, and above all by the Philistines,
who were able to enter this fertile valley by its western gateway.
Acting on the advice of the spies whom they had sent out to
find a more favorable place of abode, a large body of the Danites
migrated to the north. At the foot of Mount Hermon, amidst
the rushing waters which come from the copious sources of the
Jordan, they found a Sidonian colony.<sup><a href="#z78">(78)</a></sup> It had probably been
established as a trading outpost, for past it ran the great highway
from Damascus through Northern Israel. It was cut off
from all connection with its parent city by the heights of upper
Galilee. The Danites suddenly attacked the city, put to death
its inhabitants, and changed its name from Laish to Dan. Thus
was founded a city which became the famous sanctuary of the
north.</p>

<p><b>The Moabite Invasion.</b> All the earlier narratives of the
Old Testament indicate that the Hebrews undertook the conquest
of Canaan, not as a united nation, but as independent
tribes. At first they appear to have contented themselves with
the least desirable and therefore unoccupied regions. These
were scattered throughout the wide extent of the land and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
separated by zones of Canaanite cities. The result was that the
local Hebrew tribes soon fell a prey to the older races. Early
during the period of settlement the Moabites who were at first
confined to the south of the Arnon, swept over this natural barrier
and appeared at the fords of the Jordan opposite Jericho.
They even exacted tribute of the Hebrew tribes in southern
Canaan. The Moabite oppression was overthrown by the
Benjamite Ehud, who treacherously slew the Moabite king and
rallied the strong clans of Ephraim. By seizing and holding
the two lower fords of the Jordan they succeeded, with the aid
of this great natural barrier, in keeping back the Moabites; but
it is evident that by this time these aggressive foes had largely
reconquered the old kingdom of Sihon and subjugated the
Hebrews who remained east of the Jordan and south of the
Jabbok.</p>

<p><b>The Rally of the Hebrews Against the Canaanites.</b> The
rapid increase of the Hebrews led the Canaanites to revive the
old coalition, which in the days of Thotmose III had its natural
centre at Megiddo.<sup><a href="#z63">(63)</a></sup> Again this important city was the rallying
place of the Canaanites. On the great plain that extends for
miles in front of this ancient fortress was fought the battle which
decided the possession of central Canaan. Only the Hebrew
tribes of central Israel rallied on the battle-field. The Asherites
in the west, the Danites in the north, and the Reubenites across
the Jordan remained by their ships or with their flocks. No
mention is made in the biblical narratives of the tribes of Judah
and Simeon, far in the south. According to the older poetic
account of the battle, Deborah, who issued the call that
rallied the strong central tribes, belonged to the tribe of Issachar,
whose territory lay on the northeastern side of the plain.
Here near Deborah's home gathered the Hebrews, ill-organized
but patriotic and brave. Down along the highway, which ran
through the territory of Napthali from the northwestern end of
the Sea of Galilee (<i>cf.</i> p. 79), rushed Barak with his sturdy
warriors. Evidently the Hebrews had hitherto confined their
fighting to the hills, where they had had a great advantage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but now, forty thousand strong, they ventured out on the plain
to meet the Canaanites who were equipped with horses and
chariots and who were fighting on their own natural battle-field.</p>

<p><b>The Battle-field.</b> The Hebrews, however, chose their
ground wisely. On the eastern side of the great plain the hills
from the south almost meet those from the north, so that here the
Hebrew warriors from all parts of the land could unite without
a long journey across the open plain. On the other hand, they
were there reasonably free from the danger of a flank attack,
for the only direct and feasible approach to the battle-field from
Megiddo was straight across the plain to the northeast. Farther
to the west the Kishon is ordinarily not fordable, while
east of Megiddo, opposite Taanach, are probably to be found
the Waters of Megiddo, mentioned in the ancient song, for
here many springs burst from the plain, rendering it muddy and
practically impassable far into the summer. The Hebrews evidently
took their stand on the northeastern side of the Kishon,<sup><a href="#z79">(79)</a></sup>
where the main highway crosses it about seven miles from
Megiddo. The river here ploughs its muddy way through the
plain, which rises gently toward the northeast to the position
occupied by the Hebrews. Its fords are treacherous at all times
and especially so in spring. In crossing this point as late as
April, our horses would probably have foundered in its sticky
mud had not some camel-drivers waded out into the middle
of the stream and guided us over the one narrow place where
it was possible to cross without being submerged. As we looked
back two hundred yards beyond the river, its low, sluggish
stream was completely hidden. Had we not recently crossed,
we would not have suspected that it ran across the seemingly
unbroken plain. Not even the usual bushes fringed its bank to
proclaim its winding course.</p>

<p><b>Effect of a Storm Upon the Plain.</b> Evidently the Hebrews
waited before offering battle until the Canaanites had crossed
and were thus cut off from the possibility of quick retreat. The
ancient poem of Judges 5 also indicates that they chose for the
battle the time of year most advantageous for them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
references to Jehovah coming on the clouds from Sinai and
pouring out his waters, to the stars fighting in their course
against the Canaanites, and to the swollen Kishon, clearly
show that the battle was fought in the spring and that, while it
was in progress, one of those drenching thunder-storms that
sweep over the plain at this time of the year demonstrated to
Hebrew and Canaanite alike the presence of Israel's God.
The loamy soil of the plain dries quickly and is then very hard,
but when wet becomes at once a hopeless morass. The horses'
hoofs sink deep into the muddy soil and are withdrawn with
that peculiar sucking sound which the author of the poem in
Judges 5 has successfully reproduced. The Canaanites, never
famous for bravery, were quickly thrown into confusion. In
their mad endeavor to get back to Megiddo, chariots, horses,
and horsemen plunged headlong into the treacherous, swollen
Kishon, and were swept away.</p>

<p><b>Results of the Victory.</b> Apparently the Canaanite leader,
Sisera, swerved to the northward from the Kishon and escaped
over the hills of lower Galilee. Exhausted with his flight he
took refuge in the tent of a wandering Kenite and there met the
most ignominious of fates&mdash;death at the hands of a woman.
Thus the Hebrews were left masters of central Canaan and
possessors of the opulent cities and the material civilization,
which had been developing in Palestine for over a thousand
years. In the southern zone, the Canaanite cities remained unconquered
until the days of the united Hebrew kingdom, but
they ceased to be a menace to Hebrew expansion. Thus at
last, after two or three centuries of wandering, of struggle, and
of training, the different Hebrew tribes entered into their heritage
and continued to occupy it until Assyria and Babylonia destroyed
their independence and carried their leaders into exile.</p>

<p><b>The East-Jordan Tribes.</b> In the east-Jordan territory the
Reubenites settled just north of the Arnon. They were the first
to occupy their lands and the first to disappear from history.
The territory was rich and productive, but exposed to attack
from the Moabites on the south, from the Arabs on the east,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and from the Ammonites on the northeast. In the days of
Mesha, the Moabite king (the ninth century <small>B.C.</small>), they had
evidently disappeared, only the Gadites being mentioned. The
Gadites were equally exposed to attack from every side, but
they were more strongly intrenched among the hills and deep
wadies that lie south of the Jabbok. They were also more
closely in touch with their kinsmen across the Jordan and protected
on the north by the strong east-Jordan tribes of Manasseh
and Machir, whose territory extended to, if not beyond,
the Yarmuk and eastward to the borders of the desert.</p>

<p><b>The Tribes in Southern Canaan.</b> West of the Jordan the
tribe of Simeon guarded the southern outpost, but in time almost
completely disappeared from Hebrew history. The
strong tribe of Judah, from its mountain heights spread westward
to the borders of the Philistine Plain and at a later period
absorbed the territory of the Canaanite cities, which extended
from Gezer to Jerusalem. The little tribe of Benjamin was
wedged in between the great tribes of the north and the south.
The southern boundary of its territory ran close to Jerusalem
and on the east it touched the Jordan. Northward to the
Plain of Esdraelon and from the Jordan to the Plain of Sharon
extended the rich, fruitful territory of Ephraim and Manasseh.</p>

<p><b>The Tribes in the North.</b> The tribe of Issachar, profiting
most by the results of the great battle beside the Kishon, in
which it had played a central rôle, entered into possession of
the fertile territory lying south of the Sea of Galilee, probably
spreading across the Plain of Esdraelon to Mount Gilboa and
the boundaries of northern Samaria. Zebulun occupied the
territory extending up into the hills of lower Galilee. Upper
Galilee was divided between the tribe of Napthali on the east
and Asshur, whose territory extended to that of the Ph&oelig;nicians
on the west. In the upper Jordan valley, at the foot of the
southern slope of Mount Hermon, the warlike energetic tribe of
Dan was strongly intrenched.</p>

<p><b>Effect of the Settlement Upon the Hebrews.</b> Apparently
the Hebrew settlement of Canaan occupied fully a century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
With the exception of two or three important engagements, the
process was one of peaceful settlement rather than of conquest.
It was a process to which there are many analogies, especially
in the history of Babylonia and Syria. A stronger, more virile
race pressed in from the desert and gradually conquered and
absorbed the more highly civilized but less energetic peoples resident
in the land. It was only in exceptional cases that the earlier
Canaanite population was completely destroyed. Shechem, and
later Jerusalem, are familiar examples of the way in which
the conquerors and the conquered lived side by side, freely intermarrying
and in time completely fusing with each other.
This process was especially natural and easy in Palestine, because
the older population simply represented earlier waves of
invasion from the desert. The conquerors and the conquered
shared in common many traditions and institutions. Inevitably
the invaders gave up their nomadic habits and adopted
the agricultural pursuits, the civil institutions, the sacred places,
and many of the religious rites of the Canaanites. The marvel
is that during this transitional period of settlement they preserved
their loyalty to Jehovah, the God who had guided their
fathers in their wilderness wanderings.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<h3>THE FORCES THAT LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF THE HEBREW KINGDOM</h3>


<p><b>The Lack of Unity Among the Hebrew Tribes.</b> The
powerful influence of the peculiar physical contour of Palestine
on its inhabitants was clearly illustrated during the latter part of
the period of settlement. Although masters of Canaan, there
was apparently no political unity between the different Hebrew
tribes. Like the petty Canaanite kingdoms, which they had
conquered, they were all intent upon their own problems and
fought their battles independently. The story of Jephthah
reveals the same conditions in the east-Jordan country. The
result was that the Hebrews soon fell an easy prey to the invaders
who pressed them on every side. The Ammonites on the east
were ever eager to push their borders to the Jordan. It was
only the energetic leadership of Jephthah, a local champion of the
tribe of Manasseh, that delivered the Hebrews for a time from
these invaders. The land of Tob, where Jephthah took refuge,
was probably in northern Gilead. The name may be represented
by that of the village and wady of Taiyibeh, across the
Jordan east of Bethshean. Jephthah's success only aroused
the enmity of the powerful tribe of Ephraim, west of the Jordan,
and the story in Judges 12 reveals a state of inter-tribal
warfare rather than of united action against their common foes.</p>

<p><b>The Scenes of Gideon's Exploits.</b> As the event demonstrated,
the only influence sufficient to overcome the physical
forces working for disunion was a strong and prolonged attack
from without. The attacks of the Midianites, recorded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Gideon stories, were too intermittent to bring about a permanent
organization of all the Hebrew tribes. Gideon's victory, however,
possesses a large significance, for it led to the establishment
of the first Hebrew kingdom. Ophrah, Gideon's home,
is not to be confused with the town farther south in the territory
of Benjamin. It was designated by the biblical historians
as Ophrah of the Abiezrites, being named from the clan to which
Gideon belonged. It has been identified with Ferata, six miles
southwest of Shechem; but this site is more probably the Pirathon
of the book of Joshua. The Ophrah of Gideon is best
identified with 'Ain el-Farah, about ten miles northeast of
Shechem, at the head of the Wady Farah, which flows southeast
into the Jordan. Gideon's march, therefore, with his three
hundred brave followers, would be directly down this valley
and across the Jordan, either at the present Damieh ford or
farther north, opposite the point where the Jabbok breaks
through the hills of Gilead. The common identification of
Succoth with Tell Deir Alla, suggested by the Talmud, would
point to the northernmost of these two fords. The present
ruin of Deir Alla is a high mound on the eastern side of the
Jordan, about a mile northwest of the Jabbok. It commanded
the great highway along the east side of the Jordan and also the
road inland that followed the course of the River Jabbok. It
was therefore an important strategic point. If this identification
of Succoth is correct, the site of Penuel must be farther to the
east along the valley of the Jabbok. The mounds known as
Tulûl ed-Dahab, that rise abruptly to the height of about two
hundred and fifty feet in the middle of the valley four or five
miles east of Deir Alla, fully satisfy the biblical references to
this important stronghold that was later rebuilt by Jeroboam I
(I Kings 12:25). Ancient ruins and the remains of a great
wall and platform built of massive stones crown the eastern hill.
Close to its northern side runs the road from the Jordan to the
desert. The mention of Jogbehah, as an index of the route
along which Gideon pursued the fleeing Midianites, indicates
that the way of retreat lay to the southeast in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Rabbath-Ammon. Jogbehah may without reasonable doubt
be identified with the ruins of Jubeihat, which lie north of the
present road from the Damieh Ford through Es-Salt on to
Amman. This route would have been the more natural line
of retreat, for from Jogbehah it was easy for the Midianites to
escape directly eastward into the desert. Anywhere east of
the Jordan the retreating Arab host would have felt secure
from the attack.</p>

<p><b>Gideon's Kingdom.</b> The significance of Gideon's victory
lies not so much in the courage with which he responded to the
relentless law of blood revenge, nor the greatness of his victory,
but in the fact that when he returned his followers and certain
of the cities near Ophrah asked him to rule over them and to
transmit his authority to his sons. Thus a local chieftain was
transformed into a king. The kingdom thus established would
probably have survived had it not been for the cruelty and folly
of the son who succeeded him. In its widest bounds, Gideon's
kingdom was apparently very small. In addition to Ophrah,
Shechem, which was at this time the chief city in central Samaria,
Thebez, a town three miles north of 'Ain el-Farah, and doubtless
the conquered cities of Succoth and Penuel, across the Jordan
to the east, acknowledged his authority. Probably the
villages and territory included within these bounds also enjoyed
his protection. In its broadest bounds his kingdom
probably did not extend more than twenty-five miles from
north to south and the same distance from east to west.</p>

<p><b>Reasons for the Superiority of the Philistines.</b> The
foes whose aggressions compelled the Hebrew tribes to unite
in common defence and thus gave rise to the Hebrew kingdom
were the Philistines. These hardy immigrants from the islands
and shores of the northeastern Mediterranean had entered
western Palestine during the reign of Ramses III, at about the
time when the Hebrews were intrenching themselves in the
east-Jordan land, preparatory to their advance upon the uplands
of Canaan (<i>cf.</i> p. 122). It was inevitable that these strong
peoples should ultimately clash. The Hebrews succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
capturing the central plateau, but the Philistines soon surpassed
them in military strength and organization. This difference
was largely due to the characteristics of the territory in which
the two peoples settled. In striking contrast to the home of
the Hebrews, Philistia was divided by no natural barriers.
All its territory was a gently rolling plain. Its people were
united by similar occupations and interests. The result was
that, while the Hebrew tribes were fighting their battles independently
or were even engaged in civil strife, the kings or
tyrants who ruled over the four or five leading Philistine
cities had already formed a close confederacy and were fighting
as a united people. The rich fertility of the land which they
occupied also accelerated their development. Their territory
lay on the great commercial highways of the eastern Mediterranean,
so that they received the culture and the products of
Egypt on the one hand and of Ph&oelig;nicia and Babylonia on the
other. Their exposed position and lack of natural defences
also hastened the development of their military organization
and equipment. Their cities were surrounded by strong walls
and in battle they employed chariots and horsemen as well as
infantry. It is easy, therefore, to understand why the Hebrews
were beaten in the early engagements.</p>

<p><b>Scenes of the Samson Stories.</b> The Samson stories represent
the earlier stages in the protracted struggle between the men
of the hills and the men of the plains. The home of this hero of
popular story was the Danite town of Zorah, situated on the
hill which guards on the north the entrance to the Valley of
Sorek. Two or three miles to the northeast, where the valley
broadens, lay the other important southern Danite town of
Eshtaol. Somewhere between these two points was the Camp
of Dan, and here Samson was buried after his stormy, dramatic
career. Up the valley which runs eastward from Zorah was
probably the cave and cliff of Etam, where the Hebrew champion
dwelt for a time. Across the valley from the tree-clad hill
on which Zorah stood was the town of Bethshemesh, while to
the southwest it looked across the waving grain fields, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
figure in the Samson story, to Timnath, only five miles away.
With the exception of Gaza, which lay a long day's journey
across the plain, the scenes of all Samson's exploits were not
more than five or six miles from his boyhood home. Possessed
of ungoverned strength and passions, the hero was a typical
product of this western borderland and a forerunner of that
more serious conflict which soon raged between plain and hill.</p>

<p><b>The Decisive Battle-field.</b> The scene of the decisive battle
in which the Hebrews were overwhelmingly defeated and the
ark of Jehovah fell into the hands of the Philistines may have
been at a short distance from the Plain of Sorek. It is probable,
however, that Aphek must be sought farther north, where
broader plains lead up to the heart of central Israel, for the
Philistines were intent not merely upon border warfare, but
upon the conquest of the land of the Hebrews. In the Greek
text of Joshua 12:18 an Aphek in Sharon is mentioned. Thotmose
III in his list of conquered cities also speaks of an Aphek
north of Lydda and not far from Ono. Later, when the Philistines
invaded Israel by the Plain of Esdraelon, they rallied at
Aphek, which was evidently near the coast road that ran along the
eastern side of the Plain of Sharon. Aphek, therefore, must
have been situated on the southeastern side of this plain, commanding
the passes that led into Benjamin and southern Ephraim.
A little later the Philistine garrisons were at Michmash
and Gibeah, indicating that the line of approach was across
the more open valley of Ajalon, thence through the Beth-horon
pass.</p>

<p><b>Fortunes of the Ark.</b> From the northern battle-field, the
ark was first borne in triumph to the Philistine city of Ashdod
near the coast. Thence, to avert a plague, it was carried to
Gath, which is probably identical with Tell es-Safi, that guards
the entrance to the Valley of Elah. From there it was transferred
to Ekron in the north. As the lowing cows drew it back
across the plains to the Hebrew territory they must have turned
to the southeast, following the Valley of Sorek, until they
reached the city of Bethshemesh, beside which runs to-day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
railway, as it enters the Judean hills. Kirjath-jearim, where
the ark finally rested, was probably about five miles due east
of Bethshemesh, farther up the valley which led toward Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>The Sanctuary at Shiloh.</b> The history of Samuel, the seer
who was able to interpret the meaning of this great crisis in
Israel's history and to point out the way of deliverance, opens at
Shiloh, in the territory of southern Samaria. This little town
was east of the central highway and at the northern end of a
fertile plain, from which valleys radiate in all directions. The
town itself lay on a rounded, rocky hill, lower than those around
it, and was encircled by deep valleys on the east, on the north,
and on the west. The hill rises in terraces to a flattened knob
now crowned with extensive ruins.<sup><a href="#z80">(80)</a></sup> The rude mosque and
spreading tree, which are supposed to mark the site of the
ancient Hebrew sanctuary, stand in front of the hill; but the
cuttings in the native rock, in which the semblance of an ancient
altar can still be distinguished, the small rock-cut reservoirs,
and the level terrace near by all suggest that the site
of the rude sanctuary in which the ark was at first deposited
lay back of the hill now crowned with the ruins of the town.
Here doubtless the maidens of Shiloh once took part in the
religious dances. Here the people from all parts of the land
resorted at the annual feasts, and here Samuel sat at the feet of
the aged Eli. It is a quiet spot,<sup><a href="#z81">(81)</a></sup> with picturesque views of
mountain and plain, central yet apart from the streams of
commerce and war&mdash;a fitting place for worship. It never
recovered, however, from its destruction at the hands of the
Philistines after their great victory and from the loss of prestige
which came from the capture of the ark. Even during the days
of Samuel, its traditions appear to have been transferred to the
northern Gilgal, five miles over the hills to the southwest.</p>

<p><b>Samuel's Home at Ramah.</b> Samuel's home was evidently
not far from Shiloh and in the territory of southwestern Ephraim.
Of the many towns, which bear the name, Ramah, or
high place, the present Beit Rima, twelve miles in a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
line from Shiloh and eight from the northern Gilgal, corresponds
perfectly with the biblical references to the home of Samuel.
It lies in a straight line about eighteen miles northwest of
Saul's home at Gibeah. Saul's quest for his father's asses took
him over the high ridges and through the deep, picturesque
valleys of western Benjamin and Ephraim. A few trees still
grow on the hills, suggesting they were once densely wooded,
and rushing, perennial streams dash along the valleys toward
the Plain of Sharon. Ramah itself is situated where the hills
of Samaria descend to the western plain. Near by the natives
still worship a Mohammedan prophet, Neby Saleh, whose tomb
is the goal of many pilgrimages. On the hill to the east we
found many stones set up by pious pilgrims as they caught the
first glimpse of this sacred shrine. It would seem that, in this
modified form, the spirit of the great prophet of Ramah still
dominates this wild region, which is a little world in itself, apart
from the rest of Palestine. Here at Ramah, on the heights,
where stood the local altar, Samuel directed the sacrifice, and
by public act and later by private counsel on the quiet of the
house-top<sup><a href="#z82">(82)</a></sup> inspired the stalwart Benjamite chieftain to perform
those deeds of valor which proclaimed him the one divinely
fitted and called to deliver Jehovah's people.</p>

<p><b>The Site of Gibeah.</b> In returning, Saul apparently took the
highway which led southeast to the main road through central
Samaria and thence directly to Gibeah. First Samuel 14:1-5 and
Isaiah 10:29 indicate that Geba, situated on the heights opposite
Michmash, was distinct from Saul's home. The reference in
Judges 19:12-14 makes it clear that Gibeah lay close to the main
road north from Jerusalem but south of the Benjamite Ramah.
Saul's native town is sometimes confused with Geba (opposite
Michmash), but is probably to be usually identified with the
ruins at Tell el-Ful, four miles directly north of Jerusalem.<sup><a href="#z83">(83)</a></sup>
It was a commanding site, two thousand seven hundred and
fifty-four feet above the level of the sea, and therefore over
two hundred feet higher than Jerusalem and one hundred
feet higher than the Mount of Olives. The identification is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
confirmed by the statement of Josephus (<i>B. J.</i> V. 2:1) that Titus,
in advancing from the north against Jerusalem, encamped at
Gabbath-Saul, that is, the hill of Saul, between three and four
miles north of Jerusalem. The town enjoyed the protection of
the inaccessible heights of the central plateau and yet commanded
the roads which radiated in every direction throughout
the land. Like Jerusalem, it was thus central, well protected,
and a fitting site for the first capital of all Israel.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Jabesh-Gilead.</b> The site of the Israelite city
of Jabesh-Gilead, across the Jordan, whose messengers aroused
Saul to action, has not as yet been absolutely identified. The
name is preserved in the Wady Yabis, which runs from the
heights of Gilead into the Jordan a little southwest of Bethshean.
Eusebius states (<i>Onomas.</i> 268.281) that it was on the eastern
table-land, six Roman miles from Pella, on the road to Gerasa,
the modern Jerash. It is probably represented by the ruins
of Miryamim, north of the Wady Yabis, where the ancient road
leads up through the Wady Saleh to the heights seven miles
southeast of Pella. About these massive, ancient ruins are
open plains where the Ammonite hosts could assemble. Here
in the early morning was probably fought the first memorable
battle in Israel's war for independence.</p>

<p><b>The Sanctuary at Gilgal.</b> After the destruction of Shiloh
it was natural that the Hebrew tribes should assemble at
Gilgal, the sacred shrine a few miles to the southwest, and there
make king the man who had proved his fitness to lead and his
ability to deliver them from their foes. The town itself was
two thousand four hundred and forty-one feet above the sea and
was approached by a long climb from almost every side. It
stood on the top of a round hill jutting boldly out into the midst
of deep valleys. The hill is a gilgal, or circle, connected with
the rest of the land by a rocky shoulder running to the south.
On this shoulder of land are two fine rock-cut thrashing floors.
The southern front of the rocky plateau is occupied by the
present village of Jiljilia. The space on the north and west is
still unoccupied and bears all the marks of an ancient high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
place. Near the shrine of a Mohammedan saint are two terebinths,
probably survivors of the ancient sacred grove. On the
northwest, the cuttings in the rock suggest channels to carry
off the sacrificial blood, while one rock-cutting resembles an
altar, with a reservoir or underground room. About is a large
rocky terrace, where one can in imagination see the assembled
Israelites as they gathered to proclaim as king the gigantic
Benjamite warrior and thus to lay the foundations of Israel's
independence and national glory.</p>

<p><b>The Philistine Advance.</b> The scene of Israel's history was
suddenly transferred farther south. The choice of Saul as
king was equivalent to declaring war against the Philistines,
and Saul's intrepid son, Jonathan, assumed the offensive by
attacking their garrison at Gibeah. These active oppressors
of Israel soon came streaming up over the pass of Beth-horon<sup><a href="#z84">(84)</a></sup>
to crush the rebellion. At their approach most of Saul's followers
vanished and he was left with only a handful of men.
For the moment the Hebrew kingdom seemed but a wild dream.
Again it was simply the courage of Jonathan that at this crisis
turned the tide of war and gave Saul a secure throne. The
Philistines had advanced to the fortress of Michmash and, finding
no opposition, had dispersed in search of plunder. One
band turned back toward Beth-horon in the west, another went
north to the southern Ophrah, otherwise known as Ephraim.
The third band had gone eastward, along the road which led
across the barren wilderness to the Valley of Achor and the
Jordan.</p>

<p><b>The Pass of Michmash.</b> The only remnant of the Philistine
army left to guard the Hebrews under Saul was the garrison
at Michmash. In early times one important branch of the main
highway apparently led from Gibeah to the northeast, past
Geba and the pass below Michmash to Ai and Bethel. The
highway which led up from the Jordan valley and Gilead in
the east ran directly past Michmash, connecting through the
pass of Beth-horon with the main highways of the coast. Michmash
was therefore the key to central Canaan. The Wady es-Suweinit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is broad and shallow in its upper course below the
village of Michmash, but to the southeast of the town there is
a terraced crag or plateau overhanging the valley, which here
has steep cliffs on both sides<sup><a href="#z85">(85)</a></sup>. This point was probably the
scene of Jonathan's brave exploit. Accompanied only by his
armor-bearer, he descended the cliff in front of Geba, crossed
the deep valley, and climbed up the almost sheer cliff on the
other side. The temerity of his act at first only aroused the
curiosity and scorn of the Philistines, so that they allowed him
to scale the heights unmolested. Their scorn was turned to
terror when, like a divine warrior, he attacked and slew twenty
of their number. The biblical narrative implies that an earthquake
added to the panic, which quickly spread to the ranks
of the plundering Philistines.</p>

<p><b>The Great Victory Over the Philistines.</b> Saul and his
warriors on the heights to the south looked across the ravine
and saw the tumult among the Philistines. With his characteristic
impetuosity the king, without even waiting to consult
the divine oracle, rushed in pursuit of the Philistines and was
soon joined by the Hebrews who had fled for refuge to the rocky
hills and valleys of Ephraim. The territory was well adapted
to the fierce guerilla warfare in which the Hebrews were skilled,
and the Philistines, accustomed to man&oelig;uvring upon the open
plain, were caught at a disadvantage. The pursuit swept down
through the valleys to the west, through the pass of Beth-horon,
and thence southward to Ajalon, which was the chief western
gateway of the hill country.</p>

<p><b>Saul's Wars.</b> The victory was so complete that for several
years the Philistines appear to have left Saul undisturbed. This
opportunity he improved to develop his army and to organize
his kingdom, which probably did not extend far beyond the
Plain of Esdraelon to the north. His capital, Gibeah, was
really a military camp, for he was exposed to constant attack on
every side. In the south he made a campaign against the
Bedouin Amalekites. From the southeast came the attacks
of the Edomites, and from the east the Ammonites were seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to push their bounds farther westward. In this stern school,
under the leadership of a bold, warlike king, the Israelites
learned not only to fight bravely, but unitedly and therefore
effectively.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<h3>THE SCENES OF DAVID'S EXPLOITS</h3>


<p><b>David's Home at Bethlehem.</b> The history of the united
Hebrew empire gathers about the personality of its founder,
David. The life of no other Old Testament character is
recorded with greater detail and picturesqueness than that of the
shepherd boy from Bethlehem. His native town was beautifully
situated on a spur that ran eastward from the watershed of
central Judah.<sup><a href="#z86">(86)</a></sup> It is surrounded on three sides by deep
valleys and looks eastward down upon the wilderness of Judea.
About it are fields of wheat and barley and on the hillsides are
vineyards and groves of olive and almond trees, for it is one of the
two most fertile spots in the entire territory of Judah.<sup><a href="#z23">(23)</a></sup> There
are no springs in the village itself, the nearest being about eight
hundred yards to the southeast. The inhabitants are dependent
upon rock-cut wells or cisterns, of which there are many,
or upon the water conducted by an aqueduct from the Pools
of Solomon to the southwest. The territory about Bethlehem
is pre-eminently the land of the shepherd.<sup><a href="#z87">(87)</a></sup> The traveller to-day
sees almost no cattle or large animals. Their absence is
probably due to the limited supply of water and to the frequent
outcrops of gray limestone, which make travelling dangerous for
cattle and horses. The landscape is dotted with flocks of sheep
and goats. The rocky pastures run up to the outskirts of
Bethlehem, which appears to have been in ancient times simply
a shepherd's village.</p>

<p><b>The Contest in the Valley of Elah.</b> Bethlehem lies only
ten miles south in a straight line from Saul's capital at Gibeah.
Hence the journey of the messenger who summoned David to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the service of his king was not long. The event which brought
the youthful shepherd to the attention of the nation took place
in the Valley of Elah,<sup><a href="#z88">(88)</a></sup> but twelve miles in a straight line
west of Bethlehem. Its geographical setting throws much light
upon this dramatic event in Israel's early history. The Philistine
army was drawn up between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammin,
the Valley of Dark-red Lands, doubtless so named
from the patches of dark-red ploughed land which in the
spring still impart a rich glow to the landscape. Socoh was on
the south side of the Valley of Elah and Azekah was across the
wady to the northwest. The Philistine position was, therefore,
on the southwestern side of the valley, which is here about one-quarter
of a mile wide and well adapted to the man&oelig;uvring of
their chariots. The Hebrew position was evidently across the
valley on the steep bluff to the northeast, with its left flank at
the entrance of the wady and highway which led to Bethlehem
and Gibeah. Through the middle of the fertile valley the
mountain torrent has cut a deep ravine, with steep banks on
either side and a bed strewn with white stones. The strength
of the strategic position occupied by each of the two armies
and the danger involved in advancing through the deep ravine,
clearly explain their delay in making an attack. The situation
also reveals the courage of the youth who dared cross the deep
ravine and advance single-handed across the plain against the
Philistine champion. It is not strange that the moment David
slew Goliath, the Bethlehem shepherd became the idol of the
people. It was equally natural that the impulsive Saul should
feel a growing jealousy toward the one who seemed to have
stolen from him the heart of the people.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Nob.</b> Nob, where David deposited with the
priest the sword of Goliath, thereby consecrating it to Jehovah,
was situated somewhere on the heights a short distance north of
Jerusalem. Beside the main road, which runs northward,
about midway between Jerusalem and Gibeah, is a level plateau,
now known as Ras el-Masherif.<sup><a href="#z89">(89)</a></sup> It is about eight hundred
yards from east to west and about three hundred from north to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
south, and is probably to be identified not only with the Hebrew
Nob, but also with the Scopus of Josephus. It commands a
clear view of Jerusalem. On one side are ancient rock tombs
and cisterns, indicating the presence in earlier times of a small
village. While the identification is not certain, the ancient
Nob was undoubtedly situated not far from this point. Here
David stopped as he fled southward to escape Saul's murderous
jealousy. It was here that he committed one of the great sins
of his life, in deceiving the priests of Nob, thereby sacrificing
them to Saul's fury. From Nob David evidently turned to
the southwest to find refuge among the Canaanite cities in the
lowland between Judah and Philistia.</p>

<p><b>The Stronghold of Adullam.</b> Adullam, the stronghold
to which he escaped, is without much doubt to be identified
with Id-el-ma, in the valley of the Wady es-Sur, two or three
miles south of the scene of his victory over Goliath. It is a
steep hill, standing out in the valley, with a well at the foot
and caves of moderate size near the top. It commands the two
roads which lead up from Beit-Jibrin, in the west, and Hebron,
to the southeast. From this point it was also possible to watch
the paths that came down from the north and the northeast.
At the same time it was on the border of the Philistine land,
which offered an open asylum to all refugees from the court of
Saul. From Adullam a rough, rocky trail, the difficulties of
which were no barrier to the clansmen and outlaws who gathered
about David, led to Bethlehem, twelve miles away.</p>

<p><b>Keilah.</b> Between three and four miles south of Adullam,
in the Wady es-Sur, lay the important Judean town of Keilah.
It is mentioned several times in the Tell el-Amarna letters and
was evidently at this time the most important southwestern outpost
of Judah. Its terraced slopes are still covered with grain,
even as in David's time. These same fields supplied the grain
for the threshing-floors which the Philistine marauders came
to rob. By delivering Keilah, David was able to proclaim
in clearest terms his loyalty to his kinsmen and to win the devotion
of the southern clans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span><b>Scenes of David's Outlaw Life in Southeastern Judah.</b>
In a walled city David was in great danger of being captured
by Saul. He therefore fled to the borders of southern Judah.
Here pursuit was more difficult and escape into the rocky wilderness,
which extended eastward to the Dead Sea, was easy. David
kept close, however, to the settled territory. To the south of
Hebron lay the second most fertile spot in all Judah. It was a
level plateau, about nine miles long and three wide, covered with
fertile though rocky fields and studded with prosperous villages.
The town of Ziph, which evidently gave its name to the wilderness
to the east where David took refuge, is in the heart of this
plateau. The name of the hill, Hachilah, where, according
to the oldest tradition, David spared the life of the sleeping
Saul, is perhaps still echoed in the name Dhahret el-Kolah,
which is given to the range of hills which runs far out into the
wilderness east of Ziph.<sup><a href="#z90">(90)</a></sup> South of Ziph are the towns of Carmel
and Maon. They are encircled by fruitful fields and
pasture lands. On the borders of these the Bedouin still encamp
and exact their toll of the villagers, even as David demanded
a gift from Nabal in return for the protection given
to his flocks.<sup><a href="#z26">(26)</a></sup> David's marriage with Abigail, which followed
the death of Nabal, strengthened the loyalty of the southern
tribes and gave him wealth and a settled place of abode; but,
as at Keilah, it exposed him to great danger of capture by Saul.</p>

<p><b>David at Gath.</b> The necessity of providing occupation for
the restless warriors who followed him was probably another
reason why David at last sought refuge among Saul's foes, the
Philistines. Gath, which is probably to be identified with Tell
el-Safi, commanded the point where the Valley of Elah opens
into the Philistine Plain. It was the Philistine city nearest to
the scene of David's first great victory, as well as to Adullam,
whither he had first fled. Throughout the reigns of David and
Solomon, Gath figures as the gateway to the land of the Philistines.
Its king, or tyrant, received David readily and showed
him the hospitality that is eagerly accorded in the East to a
fugitive from the court of a rival king. David's rare personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
charm also won this Philistine chieftain, even as it did all
with whom he came in contact. The region about Gath, however,
was thickly settled and presented no field of activity for
David's followers. Hence he was assigned a frontier town
and thereby made the guardian of the Philistine border.</p>

<p><b>At Ziklag.</b> The identification of Ziklag is uncertain. That
which would place it at Zuheilika, nineteen miles southwest
from Beit-Jibrin and eleven southeast from Gaza, is on the
whole the most probable. The ruin lies on three low hills,
and it appears to have been a characteristic border town. From
this town David, with his warriors, was able not only to repel
all Bedouin attacks, but also to make forays upon the desert
tribes that wandered in the wilderness far to the south. It
gave Israel's future king and his followers experience in hard,
dangerous warfare and yet allowed him, without arousing the
suspicions of the Philistines, to show his loyalty to his race and
especially to the Hebrew tribes of the south who were most exposed
to these Bedouin robbers.</p>

<p><b>Reasons Why the Philistines Invaded Israel in the North.</b>
The presence of David in their midst, as well as their knowledge
of the growing weakness of Saul's rule, impelled the
Philistines to gather their united forces in another attempt to
crush the Hebrew kingdom. This time they wisely avoided the
narrow and easily defended passes that led into the heart of
southern Israel. Instead, they followed the coast road up across
the Plain of Sharon and then cut across possibly past Megiddo
to the eastern side of the Plain of Esdraelon. This method of
approach enabled the Philistines to advance over broad plains,
where opposition was not easy and where their chariots could
pass without difficulty. In this way they separated the Hebrews
of the north from those of the south at the point where
the connection between the different parts of the land of Israel
was naturally weakest. Doubtless their aim was also to keep
open to commerce the great highway that led from Philistia
across the Plain of Esdraelon to Damascus and Babylonia.
They apparently took up their position near Shunem, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
foot of Little Hermon, on the northern side of the Valley of
Jezreel,<sup><a href="#z10">(10)</a></sup> while the Hebrew army occupied a strong position
on the northern end of the sloping heights of Mount Gilboa.</p>

<p><b>Saul's Journey to Endor.</b> Saul's night journey to consult
the medium of Endor took him across the Plain of Jezreel and
up through the wide valley which leads east of Shunem and
Little Hermon to the south of Mount Tabor. The small village
of Endor lay on the northern slopes of Little Hermon,
facing Mount Tabor across the valley.<sup><a href="#z9">(9)</a></sup> To-day the crest of the
hill is pierced by deep caves, in which the squalid natives reside.<sup><a href="#z91">(91)</a></sup>
These caves with their dark passages were well-adapted
to the occult arts which still survived, even though Saul himself
had earlier tried to banish them from his kingdom.</p>

<p><b>The Battle on Gilboa.</b> Saul's courage was well illustrated
in the final battle on Gilboa. His position was evidently chosen
because the northern end of Gilboa commanded the valley of
Esdraelon as well as that of Jezreel.<sup><a href="#z11">(11)</a></sup> To gain control of the
highways which led across these valleys, the Philistines were
therefore compelled to dislodge the Hebrew army and in so
doing to fight against great odds. To make the attack directly
on the north from the direction of Shunem was practically impossible,
for at this point the Brook Jalud is so deep that it is
impassable for an army. The rocky hills of Gilboa also rise
very abruptly.<sup><a href="#z10">(10)</a></sup> The probabilities are that in making the
attack the Philistines marched down the eastern side of the
Plain of Esdraelon and then advanced toward the heights of
Gilboa from the southwest by the sloping terraces that lead
gradually to the top. Here they could also utilize their chariots
and preserve their battle array. By this formidable army the
scattered and disheartened forces that rallied about Saul were
quickly defeated. The disaster was overwhelming; the valiant
king and his sons fought desperately, with no thought of retreat.
Thus fell on the heights of Gilboa the man who laid the
foundations of the Hebrew empire, leaving the Philistines in
possession of Northern Israel. The half-Canaanite town of Bethshean<sup><a href="#z12">(12)</a></sup>
on the Plain of Jezreel appears to have surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
at once to the Philistines, for the body of Saul was hung in
derision on its walls soon after the battle. From the heights
of Gilead in a midnight march across the Jordan came the
men of Jabesh-Gilead to capture the body of the fallen king
and to bury it within their own territory, that they might thus
repay the large debt which they owed to their deliverer.</p>

<p><b>The Remnant of Saul's Kingdom.</b> Throughout this
earlier period the east-Jordan tribes were especially loyal to the
house of Saul, probably because of his early act of deliverance
as well as his later wars against their foes in the east. It was
natural, therefore, that the capital of the remnant of his kingdom
should be established at Mahanaim in Gilead. The
exact site of this important city of the east-Jordan has not yet
been determined. Probably it was at the ruins of Mahneh,
north of the present city of Ajlun. Others would identify it
with the important later city of Gerasa, the modern Jerash, on
a brook which runs north from the Jabbok. A few biblical
references suggest, however, that it was nearer the Jordan, but
among the highlands to the north of the Jabbok. In any case
it was not far from the modern Mahneh. Here Saul's son,
Ishbaal, who succeeded him, was out of the direct line of Philistine
attack and beyond the reach of the southern Israelite
tribes, that had asserted their independence immediately after
the battle of Gilboa.</p>

<p><b>Hebron, David's First Capital.</b> David, their beloved
champion, was naturally the choice of these southern tribes.
The way in which he disposed of the spoils captured from the
Amalekites indicates that beyond doubt, even before the fall
of Saul, he was bidding for their loyalty. Accordingly he
was made king at Hebron, then the chief city of Judah and the
South Country. The ancient city lay on the hill to the northwest
of the present town.<sup><a href="#z76">(76)</a></sup> Its importance depended not upon
its military strength, but upon its central position and the
presence of perennial springs. Two of the ancient pools are
still in use. The one in the northern part of the town is eighty-five
feet long and fifty-five feet wide. The other, lower down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the valley, is still larger, being one hundred and thirty feet
square and twenty-eight feet deep. It is by this largest pool<sup><a href="#z92">(92)</a></sup>
that tradition pictures the hanging of the murderers of Saul's
son, Ishbaal. About a mile north of the town, a little west of
the old highway, is a spring and pool, called to-day the 'Ain
Sarah, which is to be identified without much doubt with the
Well of Sirah, where Joab treacherously slew his rival, Abner.
Through Hebron runs the great highway from central Canaan
to Egypt. From here many less important roads radiate (<i>cf.</i>
p. 76), making it the great centre and trading place between
Palestine, the desert, and the countries beyond. About the
city are rocky, fertile fields, and olive and vineyard clad hills.
It was, therefore, well chosen as the capital of the small kingdom
of which David was here made king.</p>

<p><b>Fortunes of the Two Hebrew Kingdoms.</b> David's authority
evidently extended to a point about five miles north of
Jerusalem. The city of Gibeon<sup><a href="#z93">(93)</a></sup> was on its northern border.
This important town was situated on a height two thousand
five hundred and thirty-five feet above the ocean, a little west
of the main northern highway and on the southern side of the
two main roads that led up from the Valley of Ajalon across the
central plateau to the Jordan. Part way down the regularly
rounded hill on which the village stood was a spring, forming a
large pool. Here, in this border town, the warriors of Joab,
David's general and those of Abner fought the fatal duel which
was characteristic of the border warfare of this period. The
Bithron, the ravine through which Abner and his men retired
to Mahanaim, was probably the Wady Ajlun east of the Jordan.
The result of the battle was indicative of the waning power
of the house of Saul and of the growing strength of David. It
is also probable that during this period he was still a vassal of
the Philistines and so enjoyed immunity from their attacks.
He was thus able to develop and organize the resources of his
kingdom. On the other hand, the divided northern kingdom
was constantly exposed to attack from the warlike Philistines
on the west and from the Ammonites on the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span><b>The Final Struggle with the Philistines.</b> The assassination
of Ishbaal by his own followers left the northern tribes
no deliverer but David. All his previous training had prepared
him for this great task. His acceptance of the fealty of
the northern tribes was equivalent to a declaration of war against
the Philistines. Regarding this important period, the biblical
records are unfortunately incomplete; but from incidental references
it is clear that the Philistines did not yield their claim
to central Palestine without a severe and prolonged struggle.
At one time they were in possession of David's own city, Bethlehem,
and he was obliged again to take refuge in the border
fortress of Adullam. As at the beginning of the war, they appear
to have seized the series of strong fortresses on the northern
border of Judah and thus to have cut off the Hebrews of the
north from those of the south. The Canaanite cities from
Gezer to Jebus, which doubtless acknowledged the Philistine
suzerainty, completed the wall of separation.</p>

<p><b>David's Victories.</b> Strong in the possession of these central
cities, the Philistines evidently invaded Judah directly through
its two main western portals, the valleys of Sorek and of Elah.
David was thus forced to depend for support chiefly upon the
tribes of Judah and of the South Country. The territory in
which this guerilla warfare was fought, and David's experience
and skill, gave him in the end a great advantage. The Philistines
were obliged to retire each year to plant and to reap their
fields, and in so doing necessarily lost many of the advantages
which they had gained. Repeated battles were fought and
each time David gained in strength. The two decisive battles
were waged in the Valley of Rephaim,<sup><a href="#z94">(94)</a></sup> a broad, shallow valley
to the southwest of Jerusalem, from which connecting valleys
ran down to Bethlehem and the south, while the main valley
runs westward into the great Valley of Sorek. On this plain,
with its broad, cultivated fields, the Philistines were able to mass
their forces and at the same time to maintain on the west their
connection with the home land. Here also David was able to
rally his followers from the south and in case of defeat to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a way of escape into the neighboring wilderness of Judah. On
this battle-field the final decisive engagement in Israel's war
of independence was fought, and the Hebrews won a sweeping
victory. As the biblical narrative states, the Philistines were
compelled to abandon their northern garrisons "from Gibeon
as far as Gezer." David at last was free to develop and organize
that larger kingdom which was destined soon to grow
into a small empire.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<h3>PALESTINE UNDER THE RULE OF DAVID AND
SOLOMON</h3>


<p><b>Establishment of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital.</b> David's
first act as king of all Israel was to break down the barrier of
Canaanite cities which separated the north from the south, and
then to establish a capital that would be free from local associations
and more central than his former capital at Hebron.
The Jebusite city of Jerusalem fully satisfied these conditions
and was at the same time by nature much stronger and better
fortified than Hebron. The original city of David apparently
included the old Jebusite city on the hill of Ophel<sup><a href="#z55">(55)</a></sup> with certain
additions, known as Millo, probably running down into
one of the adjacent valleys.<sup><a href="#z95">(95)</a></sup> Possibly, during the reigns of
David and Solomon, the dwelling-places of the Hebrews began
to climb across the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley (<i>cf.</i> p. 65) and up the
western hill, but there is no evidence that at this early date
the western town was surrounded by a wall and thus incorporated
in the City of David.</p>

<p><b>Israel's Natural Boundaries.</b> With the establishment of
the new capital at Jerusalem and the transference thither of
the ark from Kirjath-jearim, the various Hebrew tribes were
brought into a close political and religious union. The prestige
and tactful, conciliatory policy of David were important
factors in bringing about this union. The process was also
hastened by the pressure of outside foes and by the aggressive
policy toward them which David at once initiated. On the
west and north the territory of Israel had reached its natural
bounds. Never again did the Philistines make a determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
endeavor to override the barrier of the western hills and conquer
the land of the Hebrews. The Ph&oelig;nicians were, by virtue
of their position, a commercial people with no ambitions
for military conquest. On the east and south, however, Israel's
natural bounds were the desert. As long as there were strong
nations like the Ammonites and Moabites on the east, separated
from the Hebrews only by artificial bounds, there was
no guarantee of permanent peace. The past history of Palestine
had fully demonstrated this truth and David was not slow
in acting in accordance with it.</p>

<p><b>Campaigns Against the Moabites and Ammonites.</b> The
Moabites, who, during the period of settlement, had pushed
forward to the fords of the Jordan, were apparently the first
to be attacked and to become subject to David. The Ammonites,
recognizing the significance of the new west-Jordan power,
assumed the initiative and insulted David's messengers. To
aid them in the conflict they called in certain of the Aramean
princes in the north. After the downfall of the old Hittite kingdom
these Aramean peoples had pressed in from the northeast
and taken possession of the greater part of central and eastern
Syria. The desert highway that ran through the Ammonite
capital led northward through these Aramean states and thus
established a close commercial and political bond between the
two peoples. The Arameans, living on the plains and in close
touch with the most advanced civilization of the Semitic world,
were possessed of chariots and all the equipment of ancient
warfare. In these allied forces, therefore, the armies of David
met no mean foes; but in the school of constant and strenuous
warfare he had developed a strong fighting force, and in Joab
he possessed one of the best generals of the age.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Rabbath-Ammon.</b> The decisive battles of
this campaign were fought near or in Rabbath-Ammon. The
city was surrounded by rolling plains, especially on the west,
which offered ample opportunity for the man&oelig;uvring of armies.
The strength of the city itself consisted in its huge acropolis,
surrounded, like Jerusalem, by deep valleys. On the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
it was connected with the surrounding hills by a low, narrow
neck of rock. At this point were built great protecting walls
and towers. The hill itself consisted of three terraces rising
from east to west, with a main gateway on the south side.
Each of the succeeding terraces was defended by a wall. The
highest area, which included several acres, rose nearly three
hundred feet above the surrounding valleys, and it was, therefore,
the largest and in many ways the strongest natural fortress
in all Palestine.</p>

<p><b>The Water City.</b> The Water City,<sup><a href="#z96">(96)</a></sup> which was first captured
by Joab, was probably in the valley of the Jabbok, which
runs along the southern side of the acropolis. This valley, and
that which comes in from the north along the western side of the
acropolis, is the site of the modern city of Amman. The great
Roman city was also built for the most part in the Valley of the
Jabbok, or, as it is now called, the Wady Amman. Here the
waters of the brook, which were carried by aqueducts along
different levels and which were supplemented by gushing springs,
fully justify the name of Water City. Situated in the valley,
it was most exposed to the attack of the Hebrews. When it was
captured, the supply of water and food would be cut off from
the citadel above, so that, as indicated by the biblical narrative,
the fall of the entire city would be the inevitable result of
a long siege.</p>

<p><b>Extent of David's Empire.</b> The conquest of the Ammonites
and the Moabites and the defeat of the Arameans enabled
David to extend the bounds of his empire to the desert. In the
northeast it probably never extended beyond Mount Hermon,
which was its natural boundary in that direction. In the
south he fought a decisive battle with the Edomites in the
Valley of Salt, which was probably at the southwestern end of
the Dead Sea near the border line between southern Judah
and Edom. This Arab race, in its difficult mountain fastnesses,
was held in control by means of Hebrew garrisons established
throughout the land. By this means David's southern boundary
was extended to the eastern arm of the Red Sea and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sinaitic Peninsula, thus attaining in every direction its natural
barriers. In less than one generation, as a result of the energy,
tact, and broad statesmanship of David, the physical limitations
of Palestine were overcome and a strong empire was established
along the southeastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>Absalom's Rebellion.</b> As later events quickly proved,
however, the unity of the Hebrew Empire was chiefly dependent
upon the personal charm and ability of the man who built
it up. The discordant elements were still present and only
required an opportunity to break forth into a flame of civil
war. Absalom, inspired by a treasonable ambition, succeeded
in winning away the affections of the southern tribes and in
stirring up the rivalry between the north and the south.
This rivalry was traceable not only to racial differences, but to
the fundamental variations between the physical environment
and contour of Northern and Southern Israel. It was natural
that Absalom's rebellion should be launched in Hebron, the
old capital of David's kingdom. In fleeing from the rebels
David aimed to put between himself and them that great
natural barrier, the Jordan valley, which separates Palestine
into its two great divisions. Among the hills and deep wadies
of the land of Gilead he felt most secure. Here he was in the
midst of a prosperous people, intensely loyal to a ruler whose
wars and victories had at last given them immunity from the
attack of their strong foes. This part of Palestine was least
swayed by the passions of the hour and most loyal to its deliverer.
Here also David could rally his followers, without
identifying himself with the tribes of the north, as opposed to
those of the south.</p>

<p><b>David East of the Jordan.</b> In fleeing from Jerusalem,
David did not follow the line of the modern carriage-road down
to the Jordan, but went farther north, over the Mount of Olives,
avoiding the barren wilderness of Judea, which lay immediately
to the east. According to the Targums, Bahurim, the home
of the Benjamite Shimei, is to be identified with Almon, the
present Almit, one mile beyond Anathoth. By continuing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
little farther north it was possible to reach the direct highway
from Michmash to the Jordan by way of Jericho. David
probably crossed the Jordan at the upper of the two southern
fords. From this point many roads led northeastward into
Gilead (<i>cf.</i> p. 81). At Ishbaal's capital, Mahanaim, somewhere
north of the Jabbok, he made his head-quarters. The forest
of Ephraim was doubtless either immediately north or south of
the Jabbok, not far from the Jordan, among the wild hills and
deep ravines still clad with great groves of oaks,<sup><a href="#z97">(97)</a></sup> whose spreading
branches often reach down to only a few feet from the ground.
The traveller through that region to-day has little difficulty
in picking out in imagination the great oak whose extended
branches he can picture catching and holding the head of the
fleeing Absalom.</p>

<p><b>Rebellion of the Northern Tribes.</b> The wild and sudden
rebellion which sprang up among the northern tribes because
David in his hour of triumph had shown favor to the tribes of
the south spread far up the Jordan valley. Its leader was a
certain Sheba, of the hill country of Ephraim. The rebellion
was quickly put down in central Israel, but the rebels took
their final stand far in the north, in the city of Abel-beth-maacah,
at the northwestern end of the Jordan valley. It is to-day an
imposing mound, standing out in the midst of the valley, overlooking
miles of verdant meadow land, with a lofty and easily
defended acropolis. Ruins on the southeast are indicative of its
strength and importance. Through the intercession of a
brave woman, the people of the city turned over the rebel to
Joab, and thus the rebellion was put down. The contrast,
however, between the level, unbroken fields about Abel-beth-maacah
and the gray limestone hills that encircled Hebron is
significant of the wide breach between the north and the south,
which the tact of a David could only temporarily heal.</p>

<p><b>Scene of Adonijah's Conspiracy and Solomon's Accession.</b>
The closing scene in the tragedy of David's family life
was in Jerusalem. Overwhelmed by the crimes of his sons
and the burden of his own great sin, the king in his later days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
retired more and more from public life. The question of who
should succeed him was still open. The conspiracy of his
oldest son, Adonijah, by which this ambitious prince sought
to make his succession sure, culminated in a great feast "by
the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-rogel or the Fuller's
Spring." By many the Fuller's Spring is identified with the
Virgin's Fount in the Kidron valley<sup><a href="#z54">(54)</a></sup> southeast of Jerusalem.
But this identification is impossible, for it was at Gihon, which
is clearly the ancient name of the Virgin's Fount, that Solomon
a little later was proclaimed king at the command of David.
Thus in II Chronicles 32:30 it is stated that "Hezekiah stopped
the upper spring of the waters of Gihon and brought them
straight down on the west side of the city of David," that is,
to the present Pool of Siloam on the western side of Ophel
(<i>cf.</i> also II Chron. 33:14). This accords perfectly with the
statement in I Kings, that when Solomon was proclaimed king
at Gihon, he and his followers went up again to the city
which lay on the heights. The scene of Adonijah's feast,<sup><a href="#z98">(98)</a></sup>
therefore, must have been below the royal gardens to the south
of the city where the Valley of Hinnom joins the Kidron. It
was also probably a little north of the Well of Job, which is
apparently here called the Fuller's Spring (<i>cf.</i> Josh. 15:7).
Either it received water from the Virgin's Fount, or else from a
more direct source, so that it was called a spring. In the days of
Isaiah the open space about was known as the Fuller's Field,
which according to Isaiah 7:3, was near the end of the conduit
of the upper pool, by the highway which probably ran past the
southeastern end of the city. From this point it was not difficult
to hear the sound of the trumpets at the Gihon Spring,
higher up but obscured by a ridge of Ophel.</p>

<p><b>Capture of Gezer.</b> The policy of David's successor, Solomon,
was one of organization rather than of expansion.
Through alliances, sealed in the usual oriental fashion by marriages,
he sought to insure the peace of his empire. His alliance
with Egypt brought for a brief moment an Egyptian army to
the border of Palestine. The aim of this expedition was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
aid Solomon in capturing Gezer, the last stronghold left in the
hands of the Canaanites. This important strategic point Solomon
further fortified, making it one of the seven great fortresses
upon which he depended for the defence of his land.</p>

<p><b>Solomon's Fortresses.</b> Solomon also fortified Lower Beth-horon,
which was situated on the flat, fertile hill which commanded
a wide view over the western plains. This stronghold
guarded the important highway that led up from the coast,
past Gibeon to Jerusalem, with an eastern branch running
directly to the Jordan. In the same way the old Canaanite city
of Megiddo, on the southwestern side of the Plain of Esdraelon,
was fortified, thus enabling Solomon to control the great trade
route from Damascus and Ph&oelig;nicia to Philistia and Egypt.
In the north the city of Hazor, a little east of Lake Huleh, on
the road which ran north from the Sea of Galilee, was made
the chief stronghold. It was a city often mentioned in the Tell
el-Amarna letters, as well as in the story of an Egyptian traveller
of the fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small> In the south, Jerusalem was the
great military centre. Tamar, which is probably to be identified
with the Thamara of Eusebius and Jerome, southwest of the
Dead Sea, a day's journey from Hebron, guarded the road
which ran to Ezion-geber and Elath on the eastern arm of the
Red Sea. Baalath, the seventh stronghold, has not yet been
identified. From its position in the list, it would seem to be
one of the southern fortresses, though it may be identical with
Kirjath-jearaim, which guarded the western approaches to Jerusalem
through the Valley of Sorek.</p>

<p><b>Solomon's Strategic and Commercial Policy.</b> It is significant
that Solomon apparently did not deem it necessary
to guard his eastern frontiers. The conquests of David had
delivered Israel from all danger of attack from this quarter.
Solomon's chief defences were massed on the west and north,
indicating that the foes whom he feared were the Philistines
and the more distant invaders that might come from Egypt or
northern Syria. The southern fortress of Tamar was evidently
intended to guard the trade route to the port of Ezion-geber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
from which the united fleets of Solomon and Hiram of Tyre
made their long journeys past the coast of Arabia and out into
the Indian Ocean. The situation of the land of Ophir is not
certain, but the character and names of the products brought
back by the Ph&oelig;nician and Hebrew traders point strongly to
India. The so-called "Land of Ophir" was probably either
Abhira at the mouth of the Indus, or else a seaport of eastern
Arabia, through which the products of India reached the
Western world.</p>

<p><b>Site of Solomon's Temple.</b> The culminating act of Solomon's
reign was the building of his palace and temple. His
public buildings were reared on the northern continuation of
the hill of Ophel, as it rises gradually above the site of the ancient
Jebusite city.<sup><a href="#z99">(99)</a></sup> The jagged limestone rock, rising still higher
and farther to the north was without much doubt the ancient
threshing-floor of Arunah, the Jebusite, on which was reared
the famous temple of Solomon. The irregular mass of native
rock, with its peculiar cuttings,<sup><a href="#z100">(100)</a></sup> which now stands in the
centre of the Mosque of Omar, probably represents the great
altar for burnt offerings, which stood east and therefore immediately
in front of the Hebrew temple. This shrine of Solomon
took the place of the older royal high place at Gibeon,
where still a rock-cut altar may be seen.<sup><a href="#z93">(93)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Significance of the Reigns of David and Solomon.</b> The
reigns of David and Solomon gave Palestine what it had never
had before and what it rarely had again in its troubled history&mdash;a
period of comparative peace and prosperity, in which the
rich resources of the land could be fully developed. The progress
of the Hebrews during this glorious half-century was most
marvellous. From a struggling, oppressed, disintegrated group
of nomads they suddenly developed into a strong, opulent,
and united kingdom, becoming masters not only of their own
territory, but of that of their hereditary foes. The earlier
Canaanite population of Palestine was also completely absorbed
and its agricultural civilization assimilated by the conquerors.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><b>Influence of the United Kingdom Upon Israel's Faith.</b>
The great and supremely vital contest that was waged during
this period of prosperity was that between the worship of Jehovah,
which the Hebrews brought with them from the desert,
and the different Canaanite cults which they found strongly intrenched
in the land. If the Hebrews had been defeated beside
the Kishon, or if David had not overcome the Philistines in the
Valley of Rephaim, it is doubtful whether or not the religion of
Jehovah would have emerged victorious in this great contest.
The topography of the land of Palestine strongly favored the
development of many different sanctuaries, each devoted to the
worship of some local god. It was only a strong race, under a
powerful central government, that could overcome the influence
of physical environment and hold to its faith in one God. The
establishment of the united Hebrew kingdom early in their
history was therefore a mighty factor in the development of
Israel's faith in one supreme Divine King.</p>

<p><b>Solomon's Fatal Mistakes.</b> Solomon's selfish ambition
to imitate the splendor of the oriental courts about him blinded
him completely to the best interests of his family and nation.
The one important force that held together his people after
the danger of foreign invasion had been averted was their
loyalty to their Divine King. In tolerating and patronizing the
gods of his allies under the very shadow of Jehovah's temple,
though it was demanded by Semitic usage, he committed a fatal
error, for he thereby weakened the unity of the Hebrew nation
as well as his own hold on the people's loyalty. He also failed
to appreciate the spirit and traditions which his subjects had
inherited from their free life in the desert and from the days
of tribal independence when they had been struggling for their
homes in Palestine. The Hebrews, still in close contact with
the life of the desert, were suspicious of all centralized authority.
They were restive under a rule which imperiously commanded
them to toil under royal task-masters and to bring to the king
the best fruits of the soil. From their nomadic ancestors they
had inherited a thoroughly democratic ideal of the kingship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in which the first duty of the king was to act as the leader of
his subjects rather than to treat them as his slaves. Solomon's
policy, therefore, threatened to take away the two most treasured
possessions of the Hebrews&mdash;their democratic ideals and their
loyalty to one God, ruling supreme over his people.</p>

<p><b>Forces That Made for Disunion.</b> The men prominent in
the history of the united kingdom had come from the southern
tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Many of the northern tribes
had for the first time been brought into real touch with the
rest of their race in the days of David and Solomon. The
large population and by far the greater resources were found
in the north. Solomon devoted most of his building energy to
developing the south; but it was inevitable that before long
the superior strength of the north would assert itself. While
the secluded and barren hills of Benjamin and Judah restricted
their inhabitants to a relatively slow development, the broad
valleys and the fruitful fields of Northern Israel, cut by great
highways of commerce, offered to its people every opportunity
to acquire wealth and culture. During the period of stress and
struggle David was able with rare tact and organizing ability to
bind together these diverse elements in the kingdom and to
overcome the fundamental differences of physical environment;
but even during his reign the wide breach between the north and
the south was revealed. It is doubtful whether or not, in
the new stage of Israel's development, even David could have
overcome these wide differences. Unfortunately, Solomon's
foolish policy only tended to emphasize them, and his son, Rehoboam,
by his tyrannical reply to the reasonable demands of the
northern tribes, made harmonious union forever impossible.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Shechem.</b> The scene of the final breach between
the north and south was the old Canaanite city of Shechem,<sup><a href="#z101">(101)</a></sup>
in the heart of the territory of Ephraim, the most
powerful northern tribe. The town was one of the most beautifully
situated cities in Palestine and at the same time the
least easily defended. It lay in a valley between one-half to a
mile in width, between the two highest mountains in Samaria&mdash;Ebal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Ebal and Gerizim. The mountain slopes on either side were
clothed with vineyards and olive groves. From Gerizim on
the south twenty-two springs burst from the rock, irrigating
the gardens of the ancient town, which, like the present city of
Nablus, clung close to the southern mountain. Because of its
peculiar position, the city was long and narrow, extending from
east to west. The open valley at each end offered no natural defence
and the overhanging heights rendered it especially open
to hostile attack. Its importance was due to the rich territory
which encircled it and to the important highways which connected
it with Jerusalem and Hebron in the south, with central
Israel, Damascus, and Ph&oelig;nicia in the north, with the coast
plains on the west, and with the Jordan valley on the east.
At Shechem all these great roads focused, making the city
throughout all its history an influential commercial metropolis.</p>

<p><b>Significance of the Division.</b> The result of the fateful
conference at Shechem was a division of the territory of Israel
along the natural line marked out during the period of settlement
and during the early Philistine wars. The boundary line
followed the Wady Kelt up from the Jordan to the vicinity of
Michmash and thence turned a little south of the Benjamite
Ramah, running through Gibeon and westward to Gezer. To
Northern Israel fell fully two-thirds of Palestine and at least
three-fourths of its arable land. The division left Judah a
complete geographical and political unit, and, thus dissevered
from the more heterogeneous elements of the nation, free to
develop its own life and faith. The division and the civil
wars which followed inevitably weakened the strength of both
kingdoms and prepared the way for that fate which overtook
each in turn. In losing their strength and unity, they preserved,
however, their two most distinctive and precious possessions&mdash;their
democratic traditions and their undivided
loyalty to Jehovah.</p>

<h3>THE NORTHERN KINGDOM</h3>


<p><b>The Varied Elements in the North.</b> The northern kingdom
was rich in resources but lacked unity. Within its limited
territory were found almost every kind of climate, flora, and
fauna. Its population was as varied as its physical contour.
In the east-Jordan land the shepherd and the Bedouin still held
sway. Its valleys in the west-Jordan were the home of the
agriculturist. The cities on its western borders and beside the
great highways were already beginning to engage in commerce.
Around the Sea of Galilee were thriving fishing villages. Every
type of civilization, therefore, the nomadic, the agricultural,
and the commercial, was to be found within its bounds. In
view of its mixed population, its varied interests, and its exposed
situation, the only force that could hold together Northern
Israel was a strongly centralized military régime. When a
dynasty became weak, a stronger man mounted the throne.
Hence Northern Israel's history is a series of bloody rebellions
in which assassins, rising from the ranks of the army, seized the
throne and founded short-lived dynasties.</p>

<span class="caption">ISRAEL AND JUDAH AFTER THE DIVISION OF
THE HEBREW EMPIRE.</span></a>
</div>

<p><b>Capitals of Northern Israel.</b> Jeroboam, who was called
to the throne of Northern Israel after the division, came from
the ranks of the common people. His home was in the small,
as yet unidentified town of Zeredah in Mount Ephraim. At
first he established his capital at Shechem, but this city was
incapable of defence and so the centre of authority was transferred
across the Jordan to Penuel near Succoth. The occasion
of this transfer was probably the invasion of Palestine by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Shishak, king of Egypt, who overran and plundered the west-Jordan
territory. Later the capital was transferred again to
the city of Tirzah, somewhere west of the Jordan. The identification
of this city is uncertain. It may have been at the modern
town of Telluza, situated on a hill one thousand nine hundred
and forty feet above the level of the sea, immediately north
of Mount Ebal. The town has many ancient cisterns but no
spring. This identification would correspond to the statement of
an early traveller (Borocardus) that Tirzah was on a height three
leagues east of Samaria. The other more probable site is at
Teiasir, about twelve miles northeast from Shechem, on the main
highway that leads from this ancient capital through the Ophrah
of Gideon to Bethshean and the upper Jordan valley (<i>cf.</i> p. 80).
Teiasir is a central and commanding site, with extensive ruins
to the north which indicate that it was once an important city.
In II Kings 15:14 it is stated that "Menahem went up from
Tirzah to Samaria," which applies excellently to Teiasir down
near the Jordan but not to Telluza, which is one thousand feet
higher and five hundred feet above Samaria. There is little
doubt, therefore, that Teiasir represents the ancient northern
capital.</p>

<p><b>The Aramean Kingdom.</b> Northern Israel suffered from
its exposed position. At first there was war between Judah
and its northern rival, which resulted disastrously for the
southern kingdom. To aid them in the conflict, the southern
Israelites made the fatal mistake of calling in the Arameans
to attack their foes on the north. By this time the Arameans
had taken possession of northern Syria and established themselves
at the ancient city of Damascus, which lay on a fertile
oasis out in the desert, on the border line between Syria and
northern Arabia.<sup><a href="#z42">(42)</a></sup> By virtue of its central position it commanded
the land trade of Egypt, Palestine, and Ph&oelig;nicia on
the west, and of Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Babylon on the
east. It was "the harbor of the desert." The Aramean kingdom,
with its capital at this favorable point, rapidly developed
great wealth and military resources, and soon became a menace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to the independence of both Hebrew kingdoms, for the natural
line of expansion of this Aramean kingdom was toward the
south. The exposed position of Damascus alone saved the
Hebrews from complete subjugation.</p>

<p><b>The Philistine Stronghold of Gibbethon.</b> From the southwest
the Philistines, availing themselves of the weakness of the
two Hebrew kingdoms, fortified Gibbethon. This border fortress
was the scene of repeated sieges. It is probably to be identified
with Kibbiah, which lies in the foot-hills, seven miles northeast
of Lydda. Kibbiah is eight hundred and forty feet above
the ocean level and in the heart of the debatable territory
between hill and plain. The possession of Gibbethon by the
Philistines was a constant menace to the cities of southern
Ephraim, but its strength seems to have baffled the Israelite
armies for several decades.</p>

<p><b>Omri's Strong Rule.</b> It was while besieging this Philistine
stronghold that Omri, after the death of the adventurer, Zimri,
was elected king by his soldiers. He proved to be in many
ways the strongest king who ever sat on the throne of Northern
Israel. The transference of his capital from Tirzah to the
strong central city of Samaria<sup><a href="#z59">(59)</a></sup> demonstrated his military
skill and organizing ability. He also reconquered the territory
of the Moabites as far as the Arnon, and, as is recorded on the
Moabite stone, established strong garrisons throughout this
territory.<sup><a href="#z46">(46)</a></sup> He was not able, however, to repel the Aramean
armies that at this time came marching down through the open
highways from the north.</p>

<p><b>Ahab's Aramean Wars.</b> Omri's son, Ahab, proved an
even more able general than his father. In a series of engagements,
in which he fought against great odds and against
armies equipped far better than his own, he repelled the Arameans,
who overran his territory. In the first engagement,
which was fought near Samaria, the Hebrews, profiting by the
blind overconfidence of the enemy, won through a sudden
attack. The decisive battle was fought a year later near Aphek.
This city is not the Aphek on the southeastern side of the Plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of Sharon, but is probably to be identified with the modern
town of Fîk, beside the important highway which runs from
the southern end of the Sea of Galilee northeastward toward
Damascus. Ahab's courage was shown in thus going out to
meet his foe on the northeastern border of his territory. The
town lay on the top of the plateau at the end of a valley that
looked down upon the Sea of Galilee on the west. The battle
was probably fought on the level plain of the Jaulan, which
ran east of the town, and resulted in the complete defeat of the
Aramean army and the capture of its king.</p>

<p><b>Strength and Fatal Weakness of Ahab's Policy.</b> Ahab
was contented to make a favorable treaty with his fallen foe.
The captured Israelite cities were restored and a trading quarter
was set aside in Damascus for the Hebrew merchants. Ahab
evidently sought in every way to develop the commercial resources
of his kingdom. His marriage with Jezebel, the daughter
of the Tyrian king, was intended to cement more closely the
relations with this great commercial people on the west. Viewed
from the point of view of world politics, Ahab's policy in maintaining
the natural boundaries and in developing the commercial
resources of his nation was sound. By his contemporaries
he was doubtless regarded as a most successful king. His
fatal mistake, however, was that of Solomon: in his pursuit of
material splendor he disregarded the inherited beliefs and rights
of his subjects. The official recognition of the Canaanite worship
of his Ph&oelig;nician queen was even more of a menace to the
pure worship of Jehovah in Northern Israel in the days of
Ahab than in Jerusalem in the days of Solomon. Northern
Israel was pre-eminently Baal's land. Here the Canaanites
had been most strongly intrenched and their religious traditions
still pervaded the land. Communication with the Canaanites
on the Mediterranean coast was exceedingly close and there
was much in these ancient Baal cults to attract the prosperous,
pleasure-loving, cosmopolitan people of Northern Israel.
Ahab's policy did not contemplate a substitution of the worship
of the Tyrian god, Baal Melkart, for that of Jehovah, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it did mean obscuring the fundamental characteristics and demands
of Israel's God.</p>

<p><b>Elijah's Home.</b> It was natural that the prophet who was
able to analyze the situation and to point out its dangers, should
come from the borderland of the desert where Moses had first
impressed upon his people the unique character of Jehovah.
Tishbe, the town from which Elijah came, will probably never
be identified with absolute certainty, but it was somewhere in
the land of Gilead. Modern tradition fixes it at Mar Elyas,
a village a little north of the modern town of Ajlun in northern
Gilead. Amidst this land of deep, rushing river-beds and
steep, tree-clad hills, which gradually merge into the desert, was
reared this stern champion of Jehovah and foe of the degenerate
cults of agricultural Canaan. In one of these wadies, which
cut down through the Gileadite hills toward the Jordan, Elijah
found a refuge when the drought parched the fields west of the
Jordan. His other home was Mount Carmel, whose fertile top
and noble vistas resembled his native land across the Jordan.</p>

<p><b>The Scene on Mount Carmel.</b> Excepting when he found
refuge in the Ph&oelig;nician city of Zarephath, which lay on a promontory
about eight miles south of Sidon, and again at Horeb far
in the south, Elijah performed his life work almost entirely in
the narrow strip of land which lay between Gilead and Carmel.
It was somewhere on the eastern end of Mount Carmel,<sup><a href="#z102">(102)</a></sup>
where it jutted out far into the Plain of Esdraelon, that he
summoned king and people to the great conference which revealed
to them the vital issue between the religion of Jehovah
and that of Baal. Modern tradition identifies it with a site
called El-Mahrakah, Place of the Burning. A spring a little
below favors the conclusion that this was an ancient sanctuary.
This retired spot, far away from the distractions of the city life
below, was eminently fitted for the delivery of the prophet's
brief but searching message. It looked along the western side
of the plain to the old stronghold of Megiddo, the centre of the
ancient Canaanite kingdoms. Due east lay the battle-field beside
the Kishon where Jehovah fought for his people and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
demonstrated in a language that a child nation could understand,
his superiority to the local baals. To the south were
the fertile, undulating hills and valleys of Samaria, to the north
those of lower and upper Galilee, while eastward across the
plain were the hills where lay the prophet's home, and far away
in the northeast rose the snowy height of Mount Hermon.
It was a scene that spoke clearly and impressively of Jehovah's
might and of his tender love and care for his people. When
at last, after the great convocation was over, the lightning flashed
and the thunder rolled across the plain, none could doubt that
Jehovah was still in the midst of his people demanding their
undivided loyalty.</p>

<p><b>Ancient Jezreel.</b> Jezreel, Ahab's northern capital, is ordinarily
identified with the present town of Zerin,<sup><a href="#z11">(11)</a></sup> although the
absence of ancient ruins at this point renders the identification
exceedingly doubtful. The village lies on a broad elevation
rising three hundred feet above the plain and is encircled
by fertile fields which extend for miles in almost every direction.
The statement in I Samuel 29:1 that "the Israelites encamped
by the fountain in Jezreel" implies that the ancient site was
either further east near the copious spring now known as 'Ain
el-Meiyiteh, or else to the southeast under the northwestern
end of Mount Gilboa beside 'Ain Jalûd which is probably the
famous Spring of Harod of Judges 7:1. Jezreel was on the central
highway from Northern to Southern Israel and guarded the
entrance to the Valley of Jezreel. Under royal patronage this
fertile land would quickly be transformed into a paradise of
gardens and vineyards. Ancient Jezreel, however, was a paradise
in which a man listened to the tempting voice of his wife
to his undoing. In reaching out and taking with his ruthless
hand the vineyard of Naboth, Ahab condemned his family to
exile and death. The voice of the dauntless prophet of Gilead
pronounced his doom. Near this same vineyard the dogs licked
the blood of Ahab, as his body was borne back across the
Plain of Jezreel from the scene of his last battle with the Arameans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span><b>Situation of Ramoth-Gilead.</b> Like many of the east-Jordan
sites, the identification of the famous city of Ramoth-Gilead,
which was the scene of so many battles between the Hebrews
and their northern foes, is uncertain. By some it has been
identified with Reimun, a few miles west of Jerash, on one of
the northern branches of the Jabbok, but this is on no important
highway and has neither water nor the ruins of an ancient
city. Eusebius apparently identifies Ramoth in Gilead with
Es-Salt, fifteen miles west of Rabbath-Ammon, but this is too
far south to satisfy fully the biblical references and has no large
plain near by where chariots could man&oelig;uvre. Possibly the
modern Jerash, which lies on a northern confluent of the Jabbok,
was the site of the famous stronghold.<sup><a href="#z44">(44)</a></sup> The name Ramoth
implies that it was on a broad height and its prominence as a
frontier town in the Aramean wars indicates that it was in
northern Gilead. It may have been situated on the site of the
modern Remtheh in northeastern Gilead. The modern town
is to-day occupied by a Turkish garrison and stands near the
point where the main road from Bethshean and the upper
Jordan valley joined the great pilgrim highway on the edge
of the desert. This identification would be in accord with the
statement in I Kings 4:13, that Solomon's prefect, who resided in
Ramoth-Gilead, collected taxes not only from the Manassite
towns of Jair in Gilead, but also in the region of Argob, which
is in Bashan. The latter region probably lay to the north and
east of the upper waters of the Yarmuk. The implication in
Josephus's Antiquities VIII, 15:4, that Ramoth in Gilead was a
three-days' march from the city of Samaria, also favors the
conclusion that it was the extreme outpost of the east-Jordan
land. The other possible and, on the whole, most probable
site is that suggested by Principal Smith, of Aberdeen University.
He identifies it with the present city of Gadara. This
town lies one thousand one hundred and ninety-four feet above
the sea-level, on a bold plateau which runs out from the hills of
Gilead. This height, two miles wide and at least four miles
in length from east to west, is bounded on the north by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
deep valley of the Yarmuk, on the west by the Jordan, four
and one-half miles away and over one thousand eight hundred
feet below, and on the south by the Wady el-Arab, which cuts
a deep gorge into the Gileadite hills. It is due south of Aphek,
where was fought the great battle between the Hebrews and the
Arameans under Ahab, and is on one of the chief highways
which leads up from the Jordan through Arbela to join the pilgrim
highway, to Damascus and Arabia. It is, therefore, the
chief gateway and at the same time the natural fortress which
guards northern Gilead. On the wide level plateaus about
there is ample room for the man&oelig;uvring of chariots and an important
road leads directly from it across the Jordan to Ahab's
northern capital.</p>

<p><b>Elisha's Home.</b> According to Jerome, Abel Meholah, the
home of Elisha, was about nine miles south of Bethshean. The
name, Meadow of the Dance, or of the Circle, implies that it
was a low-lying valley. All these indications point to 'Ain Hel-weh,
a ruined mound beside a gushing spring on the western
side of the Jordan valley. It was surrounded by fertile fields.
Throughout all his work Elisha, in contrast to Elijah, revealed
his familiarity and close touch with the agricultural civilization
of Northern Israel. The scenes of a greater part of his activity
were the Jordan valley and the plains of Jezreel and Esdraelon,
which lead into it from the west.</p>

<p><b>Jehu's Revolution.</b> The culminating act of Elisha's work
was to call Jehu to the kingship. The call came to him as he
was directing the siege of Ramoth-Gilead. It is easy in imagination
to follow his furious ride down the heights from Ramoth-Gilead
across the Jordan and along its western side, past
Bethshean and up the Valley of Jezreel to the northern capital
of Ahab. On the open plain near the city of Jezreel he slew
his master and thence rode into the city to complete the slaughter
of the house of Ahab. By the sword he not only mounted
the throne, but rooted out the Baalism against which Elijah
and Elisha had both contended.</p>

<p><b>Rule of the House of Jehu.</b> The history of Northern
Israel for the next two generations is a record of humiliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and disaster. Jehu secured his position on the throne by paying
a heavy tribute to the king of Assyria, whose armies were
hovering on his northern borders. The active and ruthless
Aramean king, Hazael, overran Northern Israel, destroying
most of its warriors and extracting heavy tribute. In this
hour of Israel's weakness the Philistines made forays into the
south, carrying off Hebrews as slaves to foreign markets. It
was not until Jehoash, the grandson of Jehu, came to the throne
of Israel that the tide turned. Damascus, attacked in the rear
by a northern Aramean people, was unable to cope with the
Israelite armies. The east-Jordan territory was reconquered by
Jehoash's son, Jeroboam II, and the Moabites again laid under
tribute. For the first time in Israel's history a prophet arose
in the land of Galilee. In the small town of Gath-Hepher,
situated on a hill a little west of the highway which runs north
from Nazareth, lived Jonah, the son of Amittai. He predicted
that Jereboam's kingdom would extend, as it did later, from
the southern end of the Dead Sea to the gateway between the
Lebanons in the north, that marked the southern boundary
of the strong northern Aramean kingdom of which the capital
was Hamath. Again Northern Israel touched its widest bounds.
Pride and self-confidence took possession of the nation. The
military nobles who rallied about the king, enriched by the
spoils of war, enslaved their fellow-countrymen whose fortunes
had been depleted by the disastrous Aramean wars. Outwardly
Northern Israel seemed strong and prosperous, but within were
social wrongs which were eating the very vitals of the nation.</p>

<p><b>The Advance of Assyria.</b> It was at this time that Assyria
became the dominating factor in Northern Israel's history.
This enterprising and ambitious nation was apparently an
offshoot of the old Babylonian empire. It occupied the fertile
plains east of the upper Tigris. As early as the eighteenth
century <small>B.C.</small> it began to break away from the authority of
Babylon. About 1100 <small>B.C.</small> Tiglath-pileser I laid the foundations
of the Assyrian empire by campaigns in Babylonia, Elam,
Mesopotamia, and Syria; but it was not until 854 <small>B.C.</small> that
Assyria touched Israel. Then, according to the annals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Assyrian king, Shalmanezer II defeated Ahab, together with
the other princes of Syria, at the battle of Karkar. By 842 he
had conquered practically all of Syria and received tribute
from Jehu of Israel. During the reigns of the next two Assyrian
kings the advance of this great world power was stayed. But
when Tiglath-pileser IV founded a new dynasty he injected
fresh energy into the empire, recovered its lost territory, and
advanced to the conquest of Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Amos's Home at Tekoa.</b> It was probably about the time
when Tiglath-pileser IV began to institute his aggressive policy
that Amos delivered his epoch-making sermon at the royal
sanctuary in Bethel.<sup><a href="#z77">(77)</a></sup> His home was at Tekoa, twelve miles
south of Jerusalem, and but twenty-two from Bethel. Tekoa
was the eastern outpost of Judah. Broad, rich fields lay on
the north and west, but to the east it looked down upon the
barren rounded hills that descended to the Dead Sea and
toward the bold uplands of Moab in the distance. The town
was situated on an elevated plateau which commanded a view
of nearly all the places mentioned in the prophet's sermons:
Kirioth in Moab, the region about Bethel and Gilgal, and the
roads that led to Philistia, Egypt, and Edom. The dominant
feature in the landscape was the Dead Sea, with its blue waters,
its rising mists, and its gray, purple, and yellow cliffs. It was a
grim, rugged, awe-inspiring outlook and clearly made a deep
impression upon the thought and life of the prophet. Among the
dry, rock-covered pasture lands, that run up to the eastern
side of the town of Tekoa, the prophet received his training.<sup><a href="#z103">(103)</a></sup>
To-day, as in the past, it is the land of sheep and goats. The
wildness of the region and the proximity to the desert demanded
strong, stalwart shepherds, inured to hardship, keen to detect
the presence of a foe, quick to repulse the attack of wild beast
or lurking Arab robbers, and tender in their care of the young
and the injured. Among these silent, treeless hills or beside
the occasional spring, the traveller to-day meets this type of
shepherd, silent and resourceful, armed with his short, heavy,
wooden staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span><b>Influence of His Environment Upon the Prophet.</b> Here
Amos learned to champion the cause of the oppressed, to scent
danger from afar, and faithfully to sound the alarm. His occupation
doubtless took him to the annual festivals and market
days at Jerusalem and Bethel, where his shepherd training
asserted itself. He could not shut his eyes to the cruel oppression
of the poor and dependent classes by the rich, greedy nobles.
From afar he also noted the approach of the Assyrian lion.
Being a faithful shepherd he could not remain silent. As he
meditated on the situation in the quiet of his shepherd life
among the hills about Tekoa, the conviction deepened into
certainty that Jehovah in these varied ways was speaking to
him, calling him to sound the note of alarm that the rulers of
Israel might see the peril, right the wrongs, and thus save their
nation. The influence of his shepherd's life and point of
view is present in all his utterances. His message is a clear
blast of desert air, sweeping through the corrupt atmosphere
of the city, tainted as it was by that degenerate Canaanite civilization
which still polluted the centres of Northern Israel's
life.</p>

<p><b>Evidence Regarding Hosea's Home.</b> A few years after
Amos appeared at Bethel a prophet arose in Northern Israel
itself, who reiterated the message of the shepherd from Tekoa
in equally impressive terms. The superscription of Hosea's
prophecy is unfortunately silent regarding his home. Local
oriental tradition, however, has supplied this lack. One of
the most commanding heights of southern Gilead bears the
name of Jebel Ôsha, which is the Arabic for "Mountain of
Hosea." Here, according to a tradition at least three hundred
years old and perhaps based upon an older Jewish original,
the prophet was buried. Here the Bedouin still sacrifice sheep
in his honor. Possibly local tradition has preserved a fact unrecorded
in the biblical narrative. It is indeed significant that
Hosea alone of all the prophets makes frequent mention of
the land of Gilead and reveals an intimate knowledge of its
history. Thus, for example, he refers in 10:14 to the time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Shalmen, probably the Assyrian king Shalmanezer III, laid
in ruins Beth-arbel in the day of battle. The city referred
to is clearly one of the two east-Jordan towns bearing this name,
and in all probability the Arbel east of Pella in the heart of
northern Gilead. In 12:11 he declares: "In Gilead is iniquity,
yea, they have wrought vanity." Again in 6:8, probably referring
to the unidentified city east of the Jordan mentioned in
Judges 10:17, he declares:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gilead is a city of evil-doers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracked with bloody footprints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as bandits lay in wait for a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Verily they commit deliberate crime.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>View From Jebel Ôsha.</b> The bold heights of Jebel Ôsha
commanded a view of most of the places mentioned in Hosea's
prophecies. Across the valley lay the territory of the great tribe
of Ephraim whose name is constantly used by him as a synonym
for Northern Israel. A little to the northwest were the heights
of Ebal and Gerizim, which guarded Shechem and the highway
which led directly to the city of Samaria. From the same
mountain height could be seen to the northwest the rounded
top of Mount Tabor, which is the northernmost point mentioned
by Hosea. Directly across the Jordan was the northern Gilgal,
and a little to the southwest was the table-land of Bethel. Farther
south was the height of Ramah. Hosea's prophecies also
contain a surprising number of references to the lower Jordan
valley, which lay stretched out immediately below the
mountain peak which to-day bears his name. Just opposite
were probably to be found the ancient cities of Admah and
Zeboim. The former may be identified with the city of Adam,
mentioned in the second chapter of Joshua (<i>cf.</i> p. 125), which
probably stood near the Damieh ford, just below the point
where the Jabbok enters the Jordan. Farther north the Plain of
Jezreel comes down to the Jordan, while to the southwest one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
may see the Valley of Achor, the present Wady Kelt, cutting its
way through the western hills toward Ai and Bethel. Hosea
also refers to Baal-peor in southern Gilead and to Shittim in
the valley below, near the lower fords of the Jordan. Thus
there are many indications in the ancient prophecy that Hosea
lived among the hills of Gilead, and that, like Amos, he was
a man who moved among the heights with a broad outlook
ever before him. The message which these two prophets proclaimed
was as different as the vistas which opened before
them. Amos used the figures of the shepherd; Hosea those of
agricultural life. Amos looked upon the evidence of Jehovah's
might and justice; Hosea upon fertile fields and tree-clad
hills, which spoke of Jehovah's love and his gracious provision
for his people's needs. Thus the messages of these two contemporary
prophets supplemented each other, the one proclaiming
Jehovah's justice, the other Jehovah's love.</p>

<p><b>Conquest of Galilee and Gilead.</b> The rulers of Northern
Israel, however, were as irresponsive to Hosea's pleadings
as they were to Amos's stern warnings. The result was that
when in 734 <small>B.C.</small> Tiglath-pileser IV invaded Northern Israel,
an assassin sat on the throne and the rank and file of the people
were crushed by the cruelty and oppression of those who should
have defended them. Northern Israel was swept by the armies
of the conqueror. Ijon, which was a city on the rich plain
in northern Galilee between the Litany and the Nahr el-Hasbany,
that still bears the name Merj Ayun (Ijon); Janoah, a
city in the heights six miles east of Tyre; Abel-beth-maacah,
at the upper end of the Jordan valley; Kadesh, Hazor, east of
Lake Huleh and Ijon, were among the important cities captured
in northern Galilee. Lower Galilee and Gilead were also
overrun, their leading citizens transported to Assyria, and
their territory annexed to that of the Assyrian empire.</p>

<p><b>The Exiled Northern Israelites.</b> Tiglath-pileser IV left
to Hoshea, the last king of Northern Israel, simply the territory
west of the Jordan and south of the Plain of Esdraelon. After
ruling for a decade as the vassal of Assyria, this king rebelled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
For nearly three years his capital, Samaria, held out against
the Assyrian armies, but at last, late in 722 <small>B.C.</small>, Samaria fell
before the conqueror and twenty-seven thousand two hundred
and ninety of its citizens were deported to different parts of the
Assyrian empire. Some were settled in the province of Gozan
on the upper waters of the Habor River, which flows southward
into the Euphrates. They found a home, therefore, near the
centre of Mesopotamia. References in the Assyrian inscriptions
suggest that Halah was a city in western Mesopotamia.
The third colony of exiles were settled in the Median cities to
the east of Assyria.</p>

<p><b>The Fate of Northern Israel.</b> The great majority of the
people of Northern Israel were left behind in their cities and
villages. To destroy their racial unity colonists were imported
by the Assyrians from three cities&mdash;Babylon, Kutha,
which is probably the Assyrian Kutu, a city a little northeast
of Babylon, and Sippar, north of Babylon. Other colonists
were brought from Hamath, the capital of the conquered northern
Aramean kingdom. These colonists were in time absorbed
by the native population. In later history this mixed race is
known as the Samaritans.<sup><a href="#z104">(104,</a><a href="#z105">105)</a></sup> For the next century Northern
Israel largely lost its political and religious significance and
became simply a part of the great Assyrian empire. In its
brief history it demonstrated the great truth that prosperity,
opportunity, and culture do not necessarily develop strong national
character. At the same time through its prophets it gave
to the world certain truths regarding Jehovah's justice and
love which are the corner-stones of the faith of humanity.</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<h3>THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM</h3>


<p><b>Effect of Environment Upon Judah's History.</b> Compared
with the history of the northern kingdom, that of the
southern, for the first two centuries following the division of
the empire, was petty and insignificant. Judah was shut in by
its natural barriers from contact with the larger life that surged
up and down the coast plains and through the broad valleys
of Northern Israel. While it survived, the northern kingdom
protected it largely from Aramean and Assyrian invasions, so
that during this period there were few great crises to call forth
statesmen and prophets. Jerusalem, because of its size and
prestige, completely overshadowed the other cities of Judah, so
that most of the important events in the history of the southern
kingdom took place in or near the capital. The natural unity
of this little kingdom also freed it from the diverse and disintegrating
influences that made Northern Israel's history one of
civil war and bloodshed. The result was that until Jerusalem's
destruction in 586 <small>B.C.</small> the family of David, practically
without interruption, continued to sit on the throne of Judah.</p>

<p><b>Shishak's Invasion.</b> In 945 <small>B.C.</small> the throne of Egypt was
seized by a Libyan mercenary by the name of Sheshonk, known
to the biblical writers as Shishak. He set to work at once to
restore the ancient glories of the empire. To this end he invaded
Palestine and Syria and, according to the records which he
has inscribed on the great temple at Thebes,<sup><a href="#z106">(106)</a></sup> he succeeded
in capturing one hundred and fifty-six cities and districts. The
cities lying along the Philistine Plain, including Socho, Ajalon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and Beth-horon, Gibeon in the north and Sharuhen and Arad
in the south were among those captured. According to the
biblical record Rehoboam stripped the temple of its wealth in
order to pay tribute to this foreign conqueror.</p>

<p><b>War Between the Two Kingdoms.</b> As soon as the Egyptian
forces were withdrawn, Northern Israel, by virtue of its
greater resources, first recovered its strength and fortified the
town of Ramah, five miles north of Jerusalem. Ramah stood
on a prominent hill two thousand six hundred feet high, near
the intersection of the main highways running north, south,
east, and west. From this fortress it was possible to cut off all
commercial relations between Judah and the north. The king
of Judah retaliated by hiring the aid of the Arameans. When
the Northern Israelite army was withdrawn the fortress at
Ramah was razed to the ground. With materials taken from
this ruin the king of Judah fortified the old stronghold of Geba,
two miles to the northeast, thus gaining control of the main
highway from the Jordan to the Philistine Plain. In the same
way Mizpah, an imposing, massive hill to the northwest of Jerusalem,
was fortified. Mizpah<sup><a href="#z20">(20)</a></sup> lies about two miles south of
Gibeon,<sup><a href="#z93">(93)</a></sup> through which ran the old division line between the
north and the south, so it is evident that in this border warfare
the boundary between the two kingdoms remained practically
the same as before. Soon both were forced to unite against
their common foe, the Arameans, so that, with one disastrous
exception, neither attempted again to encroach upon the territory
of the other.</p>

<p><b>Amaziah's Wars.</b> In the division of the two kingdoms,
Edom and the South Country fell to Judah. Shishak so completely
weakened Judah that it appears to have early lost control
of the Edomites. Amaziah, the father of Uzziah, was the first
who succeeded in winning a decisive victory over these southern
foes of the Hebrews. The battle was fought, as in the days
of David, in the Valley of Salt, southwest of the Dead Sea.
The narrative adds that he took Sela (the Rock) by storm. It
is not clear whether this was a border fortress or, as many hold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Petra, the marvellous capital city of the Edomites, which lies
in a narrow gorge, cut out of the heart of the many-colored
limestone mountains that rise between the Ghôr and the Arabian
desert.<sup><a href="#z50">(50)</a></sup> Elated by this victory, Amaziah foolishly challenged
the king of Northern Israel to battle. The decisive engagement
was fought at Beth-shemesh, the prosperous town that
lay on the southern side of the Valley of Sorek. It was almost
due west of Jerusalem and in the heart of the lowlands along
which the northern army probably approached. Following
up the victory, the Northern Israelites tore down two hundred
yards of the northwestern wall of Jerusalem at the point where
the city mounted the northern plateau and was, therefore,
most exposed. They also looted the temple and royal palace,
thus completing the humiliation of the southern kingdom.
The conspiracy which resulted in the flight and execution of
Amaziah at Lachish, the southwestern outpost of Judah, was
probably the fruit of his folly.</p>

<p><b>Uzziah's Strong Reign.</b> Uzziah, who succeeded his father,
rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem and strengthened them by
towers that guarded the northwestern and southwestern gates
of the city. He also extended the influence of Judah in the
south, building the important port of Elath. In a campaign
against the Philistines he captured Gath, whose power had
already been broken by the Arameans, Jabneh, west of Gezer,
and Ashdod farther south. The death of this strong king,
therefore, marked a crisis in the life of Judah, for his successors
were inefficient and at this time Assyrian armies began to invade
Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Isaiah of Jerusalem.</b> It was in the year that Uzziah died
that Judah's great prophet, Isaiah, entered upon his work. His
intense loyalty to his nation and his conception of the transcendent
majesty of the Divine King who ruled over Israel, reveal
his southern birth and training. His familiarity with king,
court, and the problems of the nation leave little doubt that he
was a citizen of Jerusalem and possibly a scion of one of its
noble families. At first, like Amos, he devoted himself to denouncing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the crimes of the ruling class and the inevitable result
of their cruelty, greed, and disregard of public responsibility.</p>

<p><b>His Advice to Ahaz in the Crisis of 734 B.C.</b> When, in
735, Northern Israel and Damascus united and endeavored to
force Judah to combine with them in a coalition against the
invader, Tiglath-pileser IV, Isaiah entered upon his work
as a statesman. In person he went to advise Ahaz, as the king
was probably investigating the defences of Jerusalem, in view
of the possibilities of an impending siege. The place of meeting
was evidently south of the city, where the valley of the Tyrop&oelig;on
joined that of the Hinnom near the pool where, in earlier
days, Adonijah had rallied his followers.<sup><a href="#z107">(107)</a></sup> Isaiah's advice,
however, to make no alliances, but to simply trust Jehovah for
deliverance, was rejected by king and people. Ahaz became a
vassal of Assyria, and not only turned over the silver and gold of
the temple and palace to the invader, but went in person to
Damascus to pay homage to Tiglath-pileser.</p>

<p><b>The Great Rebellion of 703 B.C.</b> The great crisis that
called forth the majority of Isaiah's recorded sermons came
thirty years later, when Judah was again tempted to enter into
an alliance with the other states of Palestine in an endeavor to
break free from the rule of Assyria. In common with the
other little states of Palestine, it was a victim of its intermediate
position between the great world-powers, Assyria and Egypt.
Under a new Ethiopian dynasty, Egypt's ambitions were again
beginning to stir and Assyria was the chief barrier to their realization.
Therefore, Egypt by promises of help encouraged the
states of Palestine to revolt against Assyria. In 711 <small>B.C.</small> the
Philistine towns of Ashdod and Gath did actually rebel. It
was only by going about in the garb of the captive, proclaiming
in this objective way what would be the consequence if Judah
rebelled against Assyria, that Isaiah was able to arrest the attention
of the nation and save it from fatally compromising itself.
When the great Assyrian king, Sargon, died in 705 <small>B.C.</small> the
temptations to rebel were too strong to be resisted. Merodach-baladan,
of the ancient Babylonian royal line, at once instigated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a successful revolt in the lower Tigris-Euphrates valley and sent
emissaries to Palestine to stir up the vassal states in a general
uprising against Assyria. Tyre, Edom, Moab, Ammon the Philistine
cities, and certain of the neighboring Bedouin tribes united
in raising the standard of revolt against their common foe.
Egypt again promised assistance, and, although Isaiah protested
with all his powers, Judah was drawn into the coalition. Hezekiah
was made the southern leader of the rebellion.</p>

<p><b>Home of the Prophet Micah.</b> Sennacherib, the successor
of Sargon, after putting down the rebellion in southern Babylonia,
advanced with a large army to the reconquest of the eastern
Mediterranean states. It was probably while the Assyrian
king was advancing from the north that Isaiah's contemporary,
Micah, uttered his warning against the venal and greedy nobles
of Judah. The home of the prophet was Moresheth-gath.
Eusebius and Jerome describe it as a small village a little east of
the modern Beit-Jibrin, which commands the entrance to the
Valley of Zephathah, through which ran the highway from
Jerusalem to Gaza. Another important road ran from Hebron
past the mound which represents without reasonable doubt the
ancient Gath, and thence along the coast plains to the north.
It was the centre of a prosperous agricultural life and at the
same time shared the peculiar characteristics of these frontier
towns. From his home among the foot-hills<sup><a href="#z108">(108)</a></sup> Micah was able
to watch the movement of Assyrian armies and to keep in
close touch with the world-politics of his day. Like Amos, he
was inspired by the sense of approaching danger to turn his attention
to conditions within the nation and to endeavor with
all his prophetic power to prepare it for the coming crisis. The
note of alarm sounds through all his early utterances. In imagination
he pictures the effects of the coming invasions and
in the sound of the names of the villages about his home he finds
suggestions of the calamity about to overtake them. His eyes
fall first on Gath, which lay to the northwest on the highway
along which the Assyrian army would naturally approach.
His vision sweeps southward, including Shaphir, the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Suafir, five miles southeast of Ashdod on the Philistine Plain,
Zaanan and Lachish to the southwest, and other small villages
on the western borders of Judah. His eye rests last of all
upon Mareshah, which has recently been identified beyond
doubt with the large Tell es-Sandahannah, one mile south of
Beit-Jibrin. The latter was the most important city near
Micah's home, for it guarded the pass and stood near the junction
of the great highways that radiate from this point.</p>

<p><b>Judah's Fate in 701 B.C.</b> Judah experienced in 701 <small>B.C.</small>
the calamities that Isaiah and Micah had predicted. The annals
of Sennacherib state that the Assyrian king conquered forty-six
of the cities of Judah, together with innumerable fortresses
and small towns in their neighborhood; over two hundred
thousand captives, and horses, mules, asses, camels, oxen,
and sheep without number were carried away as spoils. In the
picturesque language of the conqueror, "Hezekiah was shut up
like a bird in a cage in the midst of Jerusalem" until he was
forced to surrender and to pay a huge tribute of gold and silver.</p>

<p><b>Isaiah's Counsel in a Later Crisis.</b> In this great crisis
the wisdom of Isaiah's counsel was vindicated beyond question
and his authority became so strong with king and people that
an attempt was made to remove certain of the surviving heathen
symbols from the popular worship. In the later crisis of 690
<small>B.C.</small>, when Sennacherib advanced to the conquest of Egypt, the
prophet by his advice was able to save Jerusalem. While engaged
in the siege of Lachish, the imposing fortress on the Philistine
Plain on the southern side of the Wady el-Hesy, Sennacherib
sent messengers demanding the unconditional surrender of
Judah's capital. From the point of view of the Assyrian king
it was dangerous to leave in his rear a strong fortress like Jerusalem,
which had already proved a centre of rebellion. His
demand, however, was unreasonable, for there is no evidence
that Jerusalem, at this later time, was guilty of sedition. In
the light of these changed conditions, instead of predicting
calamity as a penalty for rebellion, Isaiah advised Hezekiah to
refuse to surrender his city to destruction. The calm, unflinching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
faith of the prophet overcame the fears of the king and thus
preserved Jerusalem for another century. Without waiting
to carry out his threats against Jerusalem, Sennacherib advanced
against Egypt. From the variant traditions it appears
that in the marshy land on the eastern side of the Nile delta
his army was overtaken by a plague and he was forced ignominiously
to retreat.</p>

<p><b>The Reactionary Reign of Manasseh.</b> Assyria continued,
during the reign of Hezekiah's successor, Manasseh, to maintain
its control of Palestine. Assyrian and Babylonian customs
and religious institutions pervaded the land as never before.
Two legal contracts, drawn up in the usual Assyrian
form and dating from the years 651 and 648 <small>B.C.</small> in the reign
of Manasseh, have been discovered in the mound of Gezer.
The one records the sale of a field and the other of an estate
with the house and land. The owner of the land was a Hebrew
(Nethaniah) but the joint owners of the estate and the twelve
witnesses were nearly all Assyrians, indicating how strong was
this foreign influence at the time. The weak Manasseh was
a leader in a wide-spread reaction against the exalted religious
and ethical teachings of the prophets. The old Canaanite
cults were largely revived and the worship of Babylonian
and Assyrian deities was introduced even into the temple at
Jerusalem. Silenced by persecution, the faithful prophets and
priests devoted themselves to putting the principles proclaimed
by Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah into definite laws that would shape
the daily life of the people. The results of their work are preserved
in the book of Deuteronomy, which became the basis of
the later reformation of Josiah.</p>

<p><b>Two Prophetic Reformers.</b> The two leaders in the great
reform movement were Jeremiah of Anathoth and Zephaniah,
who seems to have had great influence over his kinsman, the
young Josiah. Zephaniah was apparently a native of Jerusalem.
Most of his prophecy is devoted to denouncing the
different forms of apostasy and the crimes of oppression then
prevalent in the capital. While Jeremiah was not a citizen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Jerusalem, he came from a neighboring village and was also in
close touch with the political, social, and religious life of the
capital.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Anathoth.</b> The little town of Anathoth,<sup><a href="#z109">(109)</a></sup>
his home, lay to the northeast of Jerusalem, just over the Mount
of Olives, at the point where the hills began to descend to the
barren wilderness to the east. It stood on a low, rounded hill.
The limestone rocks crop out at many points, imparting a
rugged appearance to the landscape. A thriving fig orchard on
the western side of the modern town recalls the forceful figure by
which Jeremiah contrasted the Jews left in Palestine with the
exiles in Babylonia. The low stone and mud buildings of the
present town are crowded close together and the dirty streets
and people remind the traveller of the men of ancient Anathoth
who persecuted their illustrious townsman. On the south the
view is shut off by the rising hills, but toward the northeast
lies Gibeon and Ramah and to the north Michmash, with its
inspiring memories. The chief view from Anathoth, like that
from Tekoa, is toward the Jordan valley and the Dead Sea.
The gray, barren hills let themselves down in gradual terraces
to the depths below. To the northeast are the tree-clad hills of
Gilead, while across the Dead Sea rise the rounded, rocky
cliffs of the Moabite plateau. Like the homes of most of the
great Hebrew prophets, it is a place of broad outlook. The
general impression of Anathoth is grim, stern, and sombre, although
here the harsh, barren landscape of the south merges
into the more fertile and pleasing hill country of the north. Even
so in the character of Jeremiah were blended the sternest, most
exalted sense of justice and a love for his nation and his countrymen
so tender and strong that he was ready to give his life,
if need be, to save them from the evils which he saw impending.
Through all his sermons these two motives struggle, sometimes
the one and sometimes the other breaking forth into expression.</p>

<p><b>Josiah's Reign.</b> In Josiah the reformers found an energetic
leader. It was during his reign that the Scythian hordes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
poured down from southeastern Europe. Some of these wild
barbarians swept down the eastern coast of the Mediterranean,
giving Zephaniah and Jeremiah the texts of their earlier sermons.
Others, turning to the east, flung themselves against
the Assyrian empire and ultimately, in union with the Babylonians,
succeeded in conquering Nineveh itself. The impending
fall of Assyria favored the work of the reformers, so
that in 621 <small>B.C.</small> the prophetic law-book was brought from the
temple and publicly adopted by Josiah in behalf of the people.
The record of the institution of this new law indicates that
Josiah's authority extended beyond the old bounds of Judah.
After the withdrawal of the Assyrian governors it was natural
that the surviving tribes of the north should again look to Jerusalem
for political and religious leadership. This fact explains
why Josiah's last fatal battle was fought against the
Egyptian king, Necho, in the vicinity of the old Canaanite
fortress of Megiddo.</p>

<p><b>The Brief Rule of Egypt.</b> Necho, the son of Psamtik I,
a Libyan who had succeeded in conquering Egypt, was inspired
by the oft-recurring ambition to recover the Asiatic possessions
once held by the empire. The approaching fall of Assyria gave
him a favorable opportunity. With the aid of the Greek mercenaries
in his service, he succeeded in conquering the Philistine
cities. The defeat of Josiah at Megiddo in 608 <small>B.C.</small> gave
him practical possession of Palestine. In the same way the
different states of Syria fell before him, so that between 608
and 605 <small>B.C.</small> he was master of the eastern Mediterranean.
This brief Egyptian rule, however, was overthrown by the
new Chaldean kingdom, which arose in lower Babylonia and,
after the fall of Nineveh, quickly fell heir to the southern and
western part of the Assyrian empire. The decisive battle between
the Egyptians and Chaldeans was fought at Carchemish,
by the Euphrates, in 605 <small>B.C.</small> and resulted in the complete
defeat of Necho's army. The Egyptians were speedily driven
from Syria and Palestine and the Chaldean authority established
in their stead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span><b>Jehoiakim's Reign.</b> By the death of Josiah the cause of
the patriotic prophetic party in Judah suffered severely. The
younger son of the dead king, who was first put on the throne, was
soon deposed by Necho and the selfish Jehoiakim was established
as a vassal of Egypt. His sympathies were with the party of
reaction and he proved another Manasseh. When the Chaldeans
appeared in Palestine their rule was readily accepted, but after
a reign of ten years Jehoiakim listened to the seductive promises
of Egypt and rebelled against his Chaldean master. It was
during the reign of Jehoiakim that Jeremiah delivered the
greater part of his sermons. By direct address and object-lesson
he denounced the follies and crimes of the king and people
and tried to save them from the calamity which he saw impending.
When the spirit of rebellion was rife he used all his
influence to keep his countrymen loyal to the Chaldeans, but
in vain. While Judah was being overrun by the Chaldean
armies, Jehoiakim died and was succeeded by his young son,
Jehoiachin.</p>

<p><b>The First Captivity.</b> In 597 <small>B.C.</small> Jerusalem itself fell before
the army of Nebuchadrezzar. The king, his nobles, and between
eight and ten thousand of the prominent men and artisans,
representing in all between thirty and forty thousand
souls, were transported to Babylonia. The object of Nebuchadrezzar
was to strip the land of its leaders and all who might
assist in carrying through another rebellion. Over the Judeans
who were left behind was placed Zedekiah, a son of Josiah.
The new king was inclined to listen to the voice of Jeremiah
and to rule for the best interests of his subjects, but he was
helpless in the hands of his headstrong nobles. For nearly a
decade Judah submitted to the strong and, on the whole, benign
rule of Nebuchadrezzar; but by 593 <small>B.C.</small> the kings of Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon encouraged, as of old, by Egypt
were again plotting rebellion. Jeremiah did all in his power
to save Judah from these fatal entanglements, but false prophets
undermined his influence and encouraged the people to hope
that Jehovah would perform a miracle in their behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span><b>The Second Captivity.</b> In 588 <small>B.C.</small> Zedekiah rebelled against
the Chaldeans. Syria and Palestine proved themselves again,
as throughout all their long history, a land incapable of united
action. Nebuchadrezzar established his head-quarters at Riblah,
on the upper Euphrates, beside the great northern highway.
From this strategic point, from which history had already demonstrated
that the Hebrew coastlands could best be ruled, he directed
the campaign against the rebellious states. Most of
them surrendered at once. Tyre and Jerusalem alone held out
against a protracted siege. The Egyptian army which came
to relieve Jerusalem was defeated on the borders of Palestine.
It was only the fear of the judgment that would be visited
upon them that inspired the followers of Zedekiah to resist as
long as they did. Even at the risk of imprisonment and death
at the hands of the unprincipled nobles, Jeremiah asserted that
the only hope lay in surrender. At last Zedekiah in desperation,
after the northern walls of the city had already been broken down
by the besiegers, fled by night through the southeastern gate of
the city, down through the gorge of the Kidron to Jericho. Here
he was captured by the Chaldeans and carried to Riblah on
the Orontes. While his life was spared, the nobles and religious
leaders who had been active in the rebellion were put to
death. About five thousand of the prominent men of Jerusalem
were carried with Zedekiah to Babylon. The city and
temple were stripped of their wealth and the walls were thrown
down, leaving Judah's capital "a ruin and a heap." Israel's
feasts were transformed into fasts and her songs into
lamentations.<sup><a href="#z110">(110)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>The End of the Southern Kingdom.</b> Not wishing to leave
the territory of Judah in utter desolation, Nebuchadrezzar appointed
Gedaliah, a grandson of Josiah's counsellor, Shaphan,
governor over the Jews remaining in Jerusalem. The new
ruler selected as the centre of his government Mizpah,<sup><a href="#z20">(20,</a> <a href="#z21">21)</a></sup> the
most commanding point in northern Judah, four and a half miles
northwest of Jerusalem. This was one of the two border cities
which had been fortified by Asa, in his war against Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Israel. The northern position of his capital suggests that his
authority, like that of Josiah, extended over a part of southern
Samaria. This inference is supported by the fact that Israelites
from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria came, under the protection
of his rule, to present offerings at the ruined temple at
Jerusalem. Many Jewish refugees soon returned from Moab,
Ammon, and Edom to put themselves under the protection of
Gedaliah's just and kindly rule. The bright promise of an
early restoration of Judah's fortunes was destroyed by the
treachery of a certain Ishmael, of the Judean royal line, who,
at the instigation of the king of Ammon, went to Mizpah and
treacherously slew Gedaliah. Contrary to Jeremiah's advice,
the Judahites who survived fled to Egypt, taking him with
them. Thus Judah was overtaken with an even more overwhelming
fate than that of the northern kingdom. Yet in
the hour of its deepest humiliation two brave souls, Jeremiah
in Palestine and Ezekiel in distant Babylon, proclaimed in
clearest terms that Judah would again be inhabited and that a
noble destiny yet awaited their nation. Above all, Jeremiah
declared that inasmuch as the old covenant between Jehovah
and the nation had been broken by the crimes of the rulers
and people, a new and more spiritual covenant would be established
between Jehovah and each individual.</p>

<h2>XX</h2>

<h3>THE BABYLONIAN AND PERSIAN PERIODS</h3>


<p><b>Jewish Refugees in Egypt.</b> After the destruction of Jerusalem
in 586 <small>B.C.</small> the Jews were to be found in three great
centres&mdash;Egypt, Babylonia, and Palestine. Egypt, because of
its friendly attitude toward the Jews and its nearness to southern
Palestine, was the refuge to which most of the Jewish
fugitives fled. Inasmuch as the approach of the Chaldean
armies was from the north, the main highway running south
from Hebron through the solitary desert was the most natural
line of escape. The result was that a very large proportion of
the Jewish race were to be found from this time on in the land
of the Nile. Even before the final destruction of Jerusalem,
both Jeremiah and Ezekiel addressed the Jewish refugees in
Egypt. They were found in four important towns. The two
nearest to Palestine were Migdol and Tahpanhes. Migdol
means tower or fortress, and the reference is evidently to one
of the frontier towns that guarded the eastern boundary of
Egypt. It was probably the Migdolos mentioned in the <i>Itinerarium
Antonini</i>, and was situated midway between Pelusium
on the Mediterranean coast and Sele, a little west of the Crocodile
Lake, the present Lake Timsah. This would identify it
with the ruins known as the Tell es-Semut, twelve miles southwest
of Pelusium, beside the ancient caravan route that ran
from Palestine to Egypt.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Tahpanhes.</b> Tahpanhes, the biblical name of
the Græco-Egyptian city, Daphne, is represented by the modern
Tell Defenneh. It lay on the right bank of the Pelusiac branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the Nile and close to the caravan route from Palestine. On
the north was the marshy Lake Menzaleh. It was, however,
close to the fertile lands of the Nile Delta and from the days
of Psamtik I an important military and commercial town.
Here were settled Greek and Ph&oelig;nician colonists, and here the
Jews who fled with Jeremiah after the murder of Gedaliah
found refuge. Here and at Migdol the refugees were in closest
touch with their kinsmen who had remained behind in Palestine
and were in a position to return thither whenever conditions
were favorable. They were also in the midst of a cosmopolitan
life that offered them ample opportunity to engage in trade,
which must have been the chief occupation of these semi-desert
towns.</p>

<p><b>Memphis.</b> A third home of Jewish colonists in Egypt was
Noph, which was the biblical designation of the sacred city
of Memphis. This great city lay ten miles south of Cairo, at
the southern end of the Nile Delta. It was a large metropolitan
city, with an exceedingly diverse population. Herodotus found
in the vicinity of the Egyptian temple of Ptah a Tyrian colony
with a temple dedicated to the "foreign Aphrodite." Here were
probably settled the Jews who had decided to make permanent
homes in Egypt, and who may have reared here a temple to
Jehovah.</p>

<p><b>The Colony at Elephantine.</b> The fourth centre of colonization
was at Syene in the land of Pathros, the biblical equivalent
of upper Egypt. Syene is apparently represented by the
modern Egyptian city of Assuan, just below the first cataract
of the Nile. In Ezekiel 29:10 Migdol and Syene mark respectively
the northern and southern boundaries of Egypt. Recent excavations
on the northern end of the island of Elephantine,<sup><a href="#z111">(111)</a></sup>
which lies in the Nile opposite Assuan, have revealed the presence
of a large Jewish colony at this point, which flourished
during the earlier part of the Persian period and was probably
established soon after the fall of Jerusalem. The island is
one of the garden spots of the Nile valley. The ruins of the
ancient city cover a low-lying hill on the southern end, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
is here fully three-quarters of a mile across from east to west.
On the east across the river are the heights of Assuan. The
view to the south is toward the rocky cataract of the Nile. On
the west, across the river, extends the brown, rocky desert.</p>

<p><b>Results of the Excavations.</b> The importance of the
ancient town lay in its position at the head of uninterrupted
navigation. From here the caravans set out for Nubia and the
upper Nile and for the oases in the east. The town was built
of Nile mud bricks, with little houses and narrow streets, and
was evidently once the home of a large and dense population.
On the western side have been discovered contracts written
on papyri in Aramaic, which indicate that here was a large
Jewish colony living on a practical equality with the Egyptians,
Ph&oelig;nicians, Babylonians, and Persians, who constituted the
population of this ancient metropolis. Familiar Jewish names
appear in these contracts, which record the sale of land and
houses. An Aramaic letter bearing the date 408 <small>B.C.</small> has also
been discovered directed to Bagohi, the Persian governor of
Palestine. From these contracts and this letter it appears that
during the earlier part of the Persian period there was within
the city of Elephantine a Jewish temple of Jahu (Jehovah),
surrounded by strong walls and protecting gates. At this
Jewish sanctuary regular offerings were presented to Jehovah
and the religious customs of the homeland were thus preserved
in the very heart of the old heathen city.</p>

<p><b>Transformation of the Jews into Traders.</b> It is significant
that the Jewish colonists in Egypt were settled in four commercial
centres. Trade was the chief occupation open to them.
Hence the shepherds and farmers of Judah were soon transformed
into traders and merchants. Widely scattered as they
were, at each important city there were colonies of Jews. In
time these were organized into great mercantile companies
which, through their agents and branch houses, controlled
more and more of the trade of the ancient East. The Jew of
to-day is the product of those centuries of commercial training
which began with the Babylonian period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span><b>Home of the Exiles in Babylonia.</b> In deporting the Jewish
captives from Palestine to Babylonia, Nebuchadrezzar evidently
followed the longer, more northern route, through Riblah
and Hamath, across the Euphrates at Carchemish, and thence
southward through Mesopotamia. Instead of scattering the
Jewish exiles throughout the empire, he settled them in a colony
on the Chebar River, which is evidently identical with the
Khabaru Canal. According to recently discovered inscriptions,
this canal ran eastward from Babylon to the ancient sanctuary
of Nippur. This region was in the northern part of the great
alluvial plain between the Tigris and the Euphrates and was
intersected in every direction by canals, which were used both
for irrigation and commerce. To escape the spring floods the
villages were built on low mud mounds, in many cases ruins of
earlier cities. The prophet Ezekiel, who was the pastor and
spiritual adviser of the exiles in Babylon, lived at a village named
after the mound on which it was built, Tell Abib. Two other
similar village mounds were called Salt Hill and Forest Hill.
Ezekiel describes their new home as "a land of traffic, a city
of merchants, a fruitful soil, beside many waters."</p>

<p><b>Their Life in Babylonia.</b> In certain psalms are found the
echo of the homesickness and longing for their native hills
which filled the hearts of the Jewish exiles. But the fruitful
soil of Babylonia was a partial compensation for what they had
lost. The active commercial life of Babylon, as that of Egypt,
developed within them the latent Semitic genius for trade.
At first they were evidently settled as a community by themselves,
a little Judah in the heart of the great empire. Here
they lived in accordance with their laws, under the rulership
of their elders, building houses, planting gardens, and rearing
up families, as Jeremiah advised in the letter which he wrote
them (Jer. 29). The result was that the majority of the Jews
in the east became so attached to their new homes that few
were found later who would undertake the arduous journey of
fifteen hundred miles to return to the stony hills of Judah. For
a great majority of those who were exiled or who fled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Judah in connection with the first and second captivity there
was no return, even though opportunities were repeatedly offered.</p>

<p><b>Condition of the Jews in Palestine.</b> The third centre
of the Jewish race was Judah itself. Even though Jerusalem
was destroyed and its population scattered, the majority of the
shepherds and peasants of Judah never left their homes. The
captives who were deported by the Babylonians appear to have
been taken almost entirely from the capital city. Those who
remained in Palestine were probably placed under the rule of
the governor of the so-called "Province beyond the River."
The title evidently originated in Babylon, for it was the designation
of the territory which lay west of the Euphrates and included
Syria as well as Palestine. Without organization and
the protection of a native ruler the fortunes of the Jewish
peasants must have been indeed pitiable. The book of Lamentations
contains references to the pitiless persecutions and
the frequent forays to which they were subject. Whenever the
local government was weakened, Judah was the object of attack
from every quarter. On the north were the Samaritans, who
could never completely forget their hereditary rivalry with the
southern tribes. At this time the Samaritan territory apparently
extended southward so as to include the cities of Gibeon
and Mizpah. On the east the Ammonites had at last succeeded
in pushing their boundaries westward to the Jordan, and in occupying
the fruitful hills and valleys of southern Gilead. East
of the Dead Sea the Moabite territory evidently extended northward
to that recently occupied by the Ammonites. In southern
Judah the Edomites, pushed northward by the advance of
a strong Arab race, known as the Nabateans, had seized not
only the South Country but the old capital, Hebron, and the
territory to the east and west. On the southwest they occupied
the important city of Mareshah and the adjacent Philistine
lowlands.<sup><a href="#z108">(108)</a></sup></p>

</div>

<p><b>Extent of the Jewish Territory.</b> The Jews were therefore
almost entirely confined to the Judean highlands. Their outposts
on the southwest were Keilah and Bethzur, on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Zanoah, which guarded the entrance to the Valley of Sorek,
and Netophah, the modern Beit Nettif, which guarded the entrance
to the Valley of Elah. The northern boundary ran
within five or six miles of Jerusalem. To the northeast the
Jews appear to have held the city of Jericho and the neighboring
Plain of the Jordan. Thus the cultivated Jewish territory
was little more than twenty-five miles in length and
breadth and included the least desirable land of all Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Evidence That There Was No General Return of Exiles
in 536 B.C.</b> The overthrow of the Chaldean Empire by Cyrus
in 538 <small>B.C.</small> gave the Jews of Babylon an opportunity to return,
for the Persian king reversed the policy of the Assyrians and
the Babylonians and aimed to develop the resources and loyalty
of each of the many peoples in his great empire. There is no
evidence, however, that more than a handful of the Jews in the
east improved this opportunity. Cyrus also adopted the policy
of appointing native princes as local governors. A scion of
the royal house of David was placed over the little sub-province
of Judah. This appointment gave the Jews a local government
that undoubtedly attracted to the homeland many refugees
from Ammon and Moab and especially from the land of Egypt.
But the sermons of the contemporary prophets, Haggai and
Zechariah, indicate clearly that those who constituted the rank
and file of the Judean community and rebuilt the temple were
the people of the land and that a general return of the exiles was
an event, still in the future, for which they ardently longed.</p>

<p><b>The Rebuilding of the Temple.</b> Even during the Babylonian
period sacrifices were offered at the great altar of native rock
that had stood in front of Solomon's temple. Perhaps even
before Cyrus gave full permission to the native peoples to
rebuild their cities and temples a few had come back to find
homes among the desolate ruins of Jerusalem. It was a small,
struggling, and discouraged community to whom Haggai in
520 <small>B.C.</small> addressed his stirring message. His call to rise and rebuild
the temple met with an immediate response. He was
also seconded by the encouraging words of his contemporary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Zechariah. The rebellions that were then shaking the great
Persian Empire to its foundations encouraged the Jews to hope
that the opportune moment had arrived to reinstate Zerubbabel.
Inspired by these hopes, the temple-building progressed rapidly.
The stones for the repair of the walls were apparently found on
the temple hill. The timbers for the gates were cut from the
hills about Jerusalem, which at this time were, at least in part,
covered with trees. By 516 <small>B.C.</small> the work was completed and
the Jewish race again had a common religious sanctuary at
which to worship.</p>

<p><b>Discouragement and Hopes of the Jews.</b> The hopes of
re-establishing the Hebrew kingdom under a Davidic ruler were,
however, completely dashed to the ground. Darius succeeded in
putting down the many rebellions and in thoroughly reorganizing
the Persian Empire. At this time the descendants of David
disappear from Israel's history. For a generation or two the
Judean community was overwhelmed with discouragement,
for it was the victim of foes from without and of its corrupt
and greedy rulers within, who enslaved the people and seized
their land. It is not clear what aroused the spirit of the discouraged
Judean community. Possibly it was the divinely
inspired vision of the great prophet, whose immortal songs
are preserved in the fortieth and following chapters of the
book of Isaiah. He appears to have been a citizen of Jerusalem,
and to the ancient capital city his message is primarily addressed.
It was a call, however, to all the scattered remnants of the
race to return and do their part in realizing Israel's noble
destiny. It was a summons to voluntary, self-sacrificing service.
It interprets the discouragements, the calamities, and the ignominies
which were then the lot of his race, not as the result of
Jehovah's disfavor, but as a supreme opportunity, if nobly improved,
to demonstrate to the world the character of the God
whom they worshipped and the saving power of the faith which
they cherished.</p>

<p><b>Nehemiah's Response to the Call to Service.</b> Before there
could be a general return of the exiles it was necessary that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt, and this required resources, influence
at the Persian court, and, above all, an energetic, able
leader. In sending a deputation to Nehemiah, the royal cupbearer
of Artaxerxes, the Palestinian Jews showed great wisdom.
At the head of this deputation was Hanani, a kinsman of Nehemiah.
The scene of this memorable interview was in the
royal palace at Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire. The
huge ruins of the ancient city, fully eight miles in circumference,
have revealed to the modern excavator its magnificence and
beauty. It is possible that the unknown author of the immortal
chapters in the latter part of the book of Isaiah was a member
of the deputation from Jerusalem. Nehemiah records how
profoundly he was moved by the recital of the misfortunes that
had overtaken the city of his forefathers. The spirit and message
of Isaiah 40-55 pervade the prayer of Nehemiah, recorded
in the first chapter of his memoirs. One Jew, at least, was
found responsive to the divine call to service. Improving a
favorable opportunity, he secured permission to go back and
rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. A royal escort and letters to
the governor of the province beyond the river prepared the
way. His journey from Susa lay along the southern side of the
Elamite mountains and thence beside the Tigris, through Mesopotamia
by one of the great highways which led from northern
Syria to Palestine.</p>

<p><b>Conditions in the Jewish Community.</b> Nehemiah has
given a vivid description of conditions as he found them in
Judah. The active foes of the community were Sanballat, the
Horonite, whose native town was apparently either Upper or
Lower Beth-horon, a certain Tobiah, who had intermarried
with the high-priestly family of Jerusalem, and Geshem, an
Arabian. Sanballat appears to have been at the head of the
Samaritans, Tobiah of the Ammonites, and Geshem of certain
Arabian tribes, that probably had already gained a foothold in
Palestine. The Judean community had been so long preyed
upon by its greedy rulers, led by the high priest and his followers,
that Nehemiah found it necessary, as a preliminary, to institute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
certain drastic social reforms. Like an ancient prophet he
preached to the rulers and, by his own example and authority,
succeeded in influencing them to set free their countrymen
whom they had enslaved, to restore to them their ancestral
fields and vineyards, and to promise never again to seize them
unjustly.</p>

<p><b>Preparations for Rebuilding the Walls.</b> Nehemiah's
chief work, however, was the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem.
In accordance with the royal grant, he was allowed
to cut timber for the gates in the king's park, which was probably
the so-called Gardens of Solomon, south of Jerusalem, near
Etam. Under Nehemiah's direction the working forces were
carefully organized. Work was begun on all parts of the wall
at once and different groups of workmen were assigned to definite
sections of the wall. While half of the people worked, the
other half stood by with their weapons, ready to repulse an
attack. Inspired by Nehemiah's energetic personality and by
the constant danger of attack, the work progressed so rapidly
that at the end of fifty-two days the walls were restored.</p>

<p><b>Character of the Data.</b> The detailed account of the building
of the walls and of their solemn rededication furnishes the
clearest picture extant of ancient Jerusalem. This account is
supplemented at almost every point by the thorough excavations
carried on along the line of the western, southern, and
eastern walls, chiefly under the direction of the Palestine Exploration
Fund. The reconstruction thus rendered possible
is especially valuable, for Nehemiah simply restored the walls
of the pre-exilic city. With the exception of the northern wall,
which is covered by the buildings of the modern city, the reconstruction
is reasonably certain at every point.</p>

<span class="caption">THE JERUSALEM
OF NEHEMIAH.</span></a>
</div>

<p><b>The Walls and Towers on the North.</b> The account begins
with the rebuilding of the Sheep Gate, which apparently
stood immediately north of the temple (see map opposite p. 203)
and was the way by which the sacrificial animals were brought
to the sanctuary. Immediately to the west of this gate the native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>rock extends northward almost on a level.<sup><a href="#z56">(56)</a></sup> Hence at
this point were built two strong guarding towers, standing apparently
on the site occupied in Roman times by the famous
Tower of Antonia. In the days of the divided Hebrew kingdoms,
the upper end of the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley, immediately west
of the temple area, had been enclosed within the city walls.
In Zephaniah 1:11 it was called, because of its peculiar shape,
The Mortar. Elsewhere it bears the name of The Second
Quarter (II Kings, 22:14, Zeph. 1:10). Through this low depression
of the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley ran the main street of the
city. It passed through the Fish Gate which opens in the
north to the great highway leading to Samaria. The Fish Gate
was probably so named because in the adjoining market quarter
the fishmongers sold their fish, which were doubtless brought
in early times, as in the Roman period, from the Sea of Galilee.
The exact course of the northern wall from this point is not
entirely clear, for the ground over which it runs is nearly level
and is to-day covered with buildings. The importance of this
wall and the difficulty of completely restoring it is shown by
the proportionately large number of workmen detailed by
Nehemiah to repair it. It probably ran in a southwesterly
direction to the Corner Gate, which was also called the Gate
of the Old Wall. From this point it would seem that Nehemiah
constructed a straight wall to the Ephraim Gate,
which corresponds to the western Jaffa Gate of modern Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>On the West.</b> Immediately south of the Ephraim Gate
the city was especially liable to assault. Here a broad, or
double wall was constructed. The remainder of the western
wall<sup><a href="#z57">(57)</a></sup> has been traced by excavations. It ran due south along
the brow of the western hill to a corner tower which measured
forty-five feet each way and rose twenty feet from an outer
ledge of rock. At this point the wall turned obliquely to the
southeast, running to the Valley Gate, where it turned due east.
The ancient Valley Gate was only eight feet ten inches wide on
the outside. Its lower sockets are still in position. The wall
on the east was nine feet thick. To the west of the Valley Gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
was a tower the base of which measured about forty-five feet
in each direction. This was probably the Tower of the Furnaces,
so named because near by the potters baked their jars
(<i>cf.</i> Jer. 18:2-4, 19:1-6).</p>

<p><b>On the South.</b> From the Valley Gate to the Tyrop&oelig;on
Valley the wall is built along the rapidly descending slope.<sup><a href="#z55">(55)</a></sup>
The comparatively few men assigned to this section indicated
that it was practically intact. Where it crossed the lower
Tyrop&oelig;on Valley it was flanked on the outside with six buttresses,
resting on a foundation wall about twenty feet thick.
The main street, leading down the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley, has been
traced from the southern end of the city to a point opposite the
temple area. It varied from twenty-five to fifty feet in width
and was paved and provided with a curb. Where it ascended
the hill there were broad, low, rock-cut steps, adapted to use by
beasts of burden as well as by foot-passengers. Opposite the
southern end of the present temple area the main street branched
eastward toward the Ephraim Gate. On the east side of the
Pool of Siloam were rock-cut steps, probably the stairs referred
to in Nehemiah 3:15 and 12:37, which led up to Ophel. The
King's Pool was in the extreme southeastern part of the city,
south of the Pool of Siloam, from which it received its waters,
but enclosed within the ancient city wall. To the north of this
was apparently the King's Garden.</p>

<p><b>On the East.</b> Along the eastern side of Ophel the wall runs
on the brow of the steeply descending hill above the Virgin's
Fount in the Kidron Valley. There is no gate in this long
section of the wall until the tower is reached which is described
in Nehemiah as the "Tower that Stands Out." Just above this
was the Water Gate, the most important western exit from the
city. From this the road led down into the Kidron Valley and
on to the Virgin's Fount, whose waters probably gave the gate
its name. This gate and the Horse Gate, a little farther to the
north, led into the official part of the city. Here on the upper
part of Ophel, to the south of the original temple area, were
the palace and armory. At the northeastern corner of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
was the Gate of the Guard, where one of the companies that
took part in the dedication of the walls, in the days of Nehemiah,
stopped before entering the sanctuary. Here excavations
have disclosed massive masonry and the course of the
original wall, which at this point turns to the northwest. It follows
the slope of the native rock, which descends suddenly on
the north to the ravine leading up from the Kidron Valley. Inside
the walls, between the Gate of the Guard and the Sheep Gate,
were the bazaars where the people could purchase those things
which were needful for their offerings.<sup><a href="#z112">(112)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Significance of Nehemiah's Work.</b> In rebuilding the
walls, Nehemiah prepared the way for that general return of the
Jews, which is implied in the seventh chapter of Nehemiah
and confirmed by the later facts of history. The story of Ezra
is a late tradition regarding one of these return movements.
Nehemiah, in reorganizing the method of distributing the
temple dues to the priests and Levites, in discountenancing
foreign marriages, in enforcing the Sabbath law, and in providing
for the support of the temple, laid the foundations for the
institution of the new priestly law and the reorganization of
the ceremonial service, which is associated with his name.
Nehemiah was thus the restorer of that new Jewish state which
rose on the ruins of the old.</p>

<p><b>Extension of Jewish Territory to the Northwest.</b> Shut
in on the south by the Edomites and on the east by the Dead
Sea and Jordan valley, the Jewish community naturally expanded
toward the northwest. In doing so it followed the great
highways, which ran northwestward from Jerusalem out upon
the Philistine Plain. By virtue of the new life and strength infused
into the Judean community by Nehemiah, it was able to
cope with the Samaritan community and to push its boundaries
northward. Within two or three centuries the arable Jewish
territory was nearly doubled and included such important cities
as Ai, Bethel, and Timnath in the north, and Ajalon, the Horons,
Modein, as well as Ono and Lod, the later Lydda, far out on the
Philistine Plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span><b>Development of Judaism During the Latter Part of the
Persian Period.</b> The Babylonian and Persian age as a whole
was for the Jews a period of overwhelming calamity and discouragement,
and yet during the latter part of this era scattered
remnants of the race began again to restore the temple and
capital city. During this era the foundations of Judaism were
laid along the lines first outlined by Ezekiel. The priests
and scribes succeeded to the earlier authority of the kings and
prophets. Loyalty to the law and ritual took the place of the
ancient loyalty to the king and state. Judaism, helpless and
exposed to the attacks of its powerful foes, stood apart from the
rest of the world, finding its joy more and more in worship,
in trust in Jehovah, and in the noble ideals and hopes that
are voiced in the psalms and wisdom writings of this period.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<h3>THE SCENES OF THE MACCABEAN STRUGGLE</h3>


<p><b>Alexander's Conquests.</b> The Persian Empire, founded
as a result of the conquests of Cyrus and the organizing ability
of Darius, after two centuries had become weak, corrupt, and
ready for conquest. On the other hand, the Greek civilization,
which had been developing for centuries in the little land of
Hellas and the coast lands of the Ægean, demanded an outlet
that it might expand naturally (<i>cf.</i> p. 10). At this critical moment
in the world's history, Alexander, the Macedonian, animated
by the lust for adventure and by an ambition to make the
world more glorious by disseminating Greek art and culture,
set out on his eastern campaigns. Within less than a decade
he carried the standards and culture of Greece across southwestern
Asia beyond the banks of the Indus. After a year of
active campaigning in Asia Minor, he completed its conquest
in 333 <i>B.C.</i> at the great battle of Issus at the northeastern end of
the Mediterranean. With the exception of the cities of Tyre
and Gaza, which were captured only after prolonged sieges,
the people of Palestine readily submitted to the new conqueror.
Egypt likewise proved a comparatively easy conquest. By
331 <small>B.C.</small> Alexander was able to turn eastward, and at the great
battle of Arbela, which was fought that year on the plains near
the Tigris, he broke the power of Persia and advanced to seize
its eastern possessions.</p>

<p><b>The Impression Upon Southwestern Asia.</b> Although
Alexander the Great died in 323 <small>B.C.</small>, before he was able thoroughly
to consolidate and organize his great empire, his conquests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
made a permanent impression upon southwestern Asia.
This lasting impression was due in part to the attractiveness
and superiority of Greek art and culture, and to the valor and
military skill of the Greek soldiers, but above all to Alexander's
desire to Hellenize the peoples and lands that he conquered. To
accomplish this end he rebuilt many of the captured cities on a
magnificent scale and established Greek colonies throughout
his empire.</p>

<p><b>The City of Alexandria.</b> The city of Alexandria in northern
Egypt was the noblest fruit of Alexander's ambition. Selecting
the level strip of land which lay between the Mediterranean
and the lagoon of Mareotis, he transformed it into a magnificent
city which diverted the trade from Tyre and in time rivalled
Rome itself. The site was well chosen, for in front of the city,
one mile away, lay the island of Pharos. This he connected
with the city by a long causeway, thus providing two large
harbors, the eastern, used chiefly in the Greek and Roman
periods, and the western, through which the city is approached
by modern ships. A canal connected Alexandria with the
Canopic or western branch of the Nile and brought to this new
metropolis the vast trade of upper Egypt as well as the products
of Arabia and India. The city itself was divided into three
distinct parts. The Egyptian and native quarter was on the
west, while the Greek and official quarter was in the centre opposite
the eastern harbor. The Jewish quarter was in the
northeastern part of the city. Many Hebrews were attracted
here by the privileges which Alexander granted them, especially
the opportunity of living under their own laws and local rulers.</p>

<p><b>Greek Influence in Palestine.</b> Alexander and his successors
also transformed the cities of Ph&oelig;nicia and Philistia and
the important towns east of the Jordan into centres of Greek
culture and civilization. Large numbers of Greek colonists
were settled at Gaza, Ashdod, Askelon, Joppa, and the ancient
Accho, which was renamed Ptolemais. In the same way Hippos,
Gadara, Pella, Gerasa, and the ancient Rabbath-Ammon,
under the name of Philadelphia, became the homes of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of Alexander's veterans and were largely rebuilt after the manner
of Greek cities. Thus, from the beginning of the Greek
period, the Jewish community in Palestine was encircled by a
ring of cities from which emanated the ideas and culture of
ancient Hellas. The history of the next few centuries is a
record of the great conflict between Semitic and Hellenic ideas
and culture and of the ultimate fusion which resulted from this
close and protracted contact.</p>

<p><b>The Ptolemaic Rule.</b> In 320 <small>B.C.</small> Ptolemy Soter, who became
the ruler of Egypt after the death of Alexander, conquered
the territory of Judea and Samaria. At this time many Jews
and Samaritans were transported to Egypt. They were granted
special privileges, for the Greek rulers recognized in them valuable
allies in the difficult task of ruling the large native population.
During the next century Palestine was subject to the
Ptolemies. It was the victim of many invasions. By virtue
of its position it was the bone of contention between the rulers of
Egypt and her rival in the east and north.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Antioch.</b> About 300 <small>B.C.</small> Seleucus I built
the city of Antioch and transferred his capital from the Tigris-Euphrates
Valley to this important strategic centre. The city
was situated at the point where the Lebanon mountains on the
south were separated from the Taurus on the north by the
Orontes River. The city lay at the northern end of the great
valley between the Lebanons, near the point where the Orontes
bends abruptly to the southwest. It was sixteen miles from the
sea and not far from the borders of the eastern desert. Here
meet the great highways from the Euphrates and from central
Syria and Palestine. It was, therefore, an important commercial
and political centre. The city itself lay on the broad, fertile
plain, which ran northward from the river up the sides of Mount
Silpius. Aside from the river and the mountain, it possessed no
natural defences, but was dependent upon the huge wall which
surrounded it.</p>

<p><b>Causes of the Maccabean Struggle.</b> In 198 <small>B.C.</small> Antiochus
the Great, in a battle near Paneion, the modern Banias, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
foot of Mount Hennon, defeated the Egyptian army and annexed
Palestine to the Seleucid kingdom. The Jews gained
little by this change of rulers. In 175 <small>B.C.</small> Antiochus Epiphanes
mounted the Syrian throne. He had been brought up in the
midst of the profligate and imperious young nobles of Rome,
and soon proved an unprincipled tyrant. He was a great admirer
of Greek art and culture and his two chief ambitions were to
adorn his capital and kingdom with magnificent buildings and
thoroughly to Hellenize his subjects. Many of the Jews, including
certain degenerate high priests at Jerusalem, readily gave
up the institutions and traditions of their race and adopted Greek
costumes and customs. Through their representatives they led
Antiochus to believe that the other Jews would renounce the religion
of their fathers. The rank and file of the Jewish nation,
however, bitterly opposed Antiochus's policy. Returning from
an expedition to Egypt, he found Jerusalem in the hands of a
rebel and made this an excuse to turn over the citizens of the
city to his bloodthirsty soldiers and to rob the temple of its
treasures. Soon after, he set about systematically to root out
the worship of Jehovah and completely to Hellenize the Jews.
In this endeavor he was aided by the renegade Jews, who constituted
a strong Greek party in Jerusalem. In 168 <small>B.C.</small> he
sent Apollonius, one of his generals, to put to death all who
refused to worship the Olympian Zeus or who preserved copies
of the Scriptures. All Jewish religious rites were prohibited,
the temple was desecrated, and on its great altar sacrifices were
offered to Zeus. The houses and walls of Jerusalem were
torn down. The citadel of Acra, which stood either on the
hill of Ophel to the south of the temple (<i>cf.</i> p. 66), or else immediately
to the north on the site of the later Tower of Antonia,
was garrisoned with Syrian soldiers and apostate Jews.</p>

<p><b>The Town of Modein.</b> In the face of this cruel persecution
the true character of Judaism asserted itself. Rather than submit
to the tyrant's demands, the thousands preferred to die or
else succeeded in finding refuge in the caves and deserted places
on the borders of Judah. Antiochus's agents, however, met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with little opposition until they reached the town of Modein,<sup><a href="#z113">(113)</a></sup>
northeast of the Beth-horons on the borders of the coast plain.
Its deserted ruins are to-day one of the most picturesque and
impressive mounds in all Palestine. Over it all is flung a luxuriant
growth of grain and olive trees. It is surrounded by
deep valleys; on the south and west the Wady Malakeh swings
in a broad semicircle about the mound, which is nearly a complete
circle, one-third of a mile in diameter. To the northwest,
connected by a shoulder of land, was the lower town, which was
a little larger in area than the acropolis. On the north lay a
deep encircling valley which made its defence easy. The sides
of the main acropolis rose rapidly in three or four large terraces.
It stood apart from the surrounding foot-hills like an emerald
set in the midst of black and gray limestone.</p>

<p><b>The First Flame of Revolt.</b> Modein was a fitting altar of
Jewish freedom and patriotism. Here the Syrian official set up a
heathen altar. By promises of royal favor he sought to induce
an aged priest by the name of Mattathias to sacrifice upon it
in accordance with the king's command. To this demand the
priest replied that if they alone of all their race remained faithful,
he and his family would never forsake the law and ordinances.
At the sight of an apostate Jew advancing to sacrifice
at the heathen altar the indignation of the stern old priest was
kindled. He slew both the offender and the royal official
and tore down the altar. He then fled to the mountains with
his five stalwart sons. Recognizing in him a leader, the Jews
who were faithful to their law soon rallied about him. At first
they devoted themselves to tearing down the heathen altars, to
enforcing the law of circumcision wherever it had been neglected,
and to putting to death all apostates whom they captured. At
this critical moment in the life of Judaism they strengthened the
courage of those who were wavering and raised a standard
about which the faithful rallied in ever-increasing numbers.</p>

<p><b>Character and Work of Judas.</b> In a few months the aged
Mattathias died and was succeeded by his son, Judas, who was
known by the distinctive title of Maccabeus. He soon proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
himself an unselfish patriot, a devoted champion of the law,
and a military leader of rare enthusiasm, energy, and strategic
skill. The odds against which he had to contend were seemingly
overwhelming. With a few unarmed peasants he was
called to meet large armies of well-equipped and well-trained
Greek mercenaries. But again, as in the days of David, the
rugged physical contour of Palestine was the chief advantage
possessed by the Israelites. Selecting a favorable point along
the road which led from Samaria to Jerusalem, Judas made a
sudden attack upon the Syrian general, Apollonius, and succeeded
not only in putting to flight the Syrian soldiers, but also
in slaying the leader of the persecution. Henceforth Judas
wielded effectively the sword of Apollonius, and his followers
armed themselves likewise with the weapons of the slain.</p>

<p><b>The Pass of Beth-horon.</b> Judas's first open engagement
was fought near his home at Modein. Seron was sent with a
Syrian army to put down the rebellion. He advanced against
Jerusalem by the main northern highway, which led up through
the pass of the Beth-horons. At this point the road ascends
very rapidly. On the Plain of Ajalon it is but eight hundred
and forty feet above the ocean level. At the lower Beth-horon
it is one thousand two hundred and forty feet. Thence a
steep, rocky road leads to the upper Beth-boron,<sup><a href="#z84">(84)</a></sup> less than
two miles away at the height of two thousand and twenty-two
feet above the sea. Four miles farther on it reaches the top of
the ascent, which is about two thousand three hundred feet
above the level of the sea. The difficult pass, often ascending
by rock-cut steps, was the scene of this memorable battle.
Here it was impossible for an army to deploy or maintain a
regular formation. A few determined men on the heights above
were able to turn back a large force. The defeat of the Syrian
army was complete. Eight hundred of them were slain during
the hot pursuit down the Beth-horon slope. The rest fled to the
land of the Philistines, out on the plain. At last, after four centuries
of defeat and humiliation, the Israelites found that by courage
and united action they could put to flight their heathen foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span><b>Scene of the Victory Over the Syrian Generals.</b> Fortunately
for the Jews, at this crisis Antiochus Epiphanes found
his treasury depleted as a result of his luxurious habits and extensive
building enterprises. Accordingly he turned over the
government of his kingdom to Lysias, one of his nobles, while
he gathered a large army and set out on a campaign into Persia,
where he ultimately lost his life. The departure of Antiochus
reduced by fully one-half the soldiers available for the campaigns
against Judas and his followers. But Lysias, appreciating
the importance of suppressing the Jewish rebellion at
once, sent out an army of forty thousand infantry and seven
thousand cavalry under the leadership of three generals, Ptolemy,
Nicanor, and Gorgias. They encamped near Emmaus on the
southern side of the Valley of Ajalon, not far from the border of
the Philistine Plain. This time they avoided the steep and
dangerous pass of Beth-horon and aimed to penetrate the highlands
of Judah through the narrow and yet direct highway
which led up by the Wady Ali, through which runs the modern
carriage road from Joppa to Jerusalem. Meantime Judas had
rallied his followers near Mizpah.<sup><a href="#z20">(20)</a></sup> This imposing height was
in close touch with Jerusalem and at the same time commanded
a view of all the roads leading from the north and west, rendering
it practically impossible for the Syrians to overtake him
unawares.<sup><a href="#z93">(93)</a></sup> Apparently the Syrian generals had pitched their
camp at Emmaus in the vain hope that by a quick night-march
they might surprise Judas and his followers at Mizpah.
Anticipating this design, Judas by night transferred his army
to a point a little south of Emmaus, probably following one of
the wild, deserted valleys which lead from Mizpah to the plain.
The result was that when a detachment of Syrian soldiers were
sent under Gorgias to capture Judas, they found Mizpah deserted.
Meantime Judas boldly attacked the remnant of the
Syrian army on the plain near Emmaus and quickly put them
to flight. Many were slain; some escaped to the stronghold of
Gezer, or Gazara, as it was called at that time, a little northwest
of Emmaus; some turned southward into the Philistine lowlands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which were held by the Idumeans; others fled as far as
Ashdod and Jamnia on the western side of the Philistine Plain.
When Gorgias and his soldiers returned and found their camp
in flames they were seized by a panic and retreated into the
land of the Philistines, leaving the Jews in possession of rich
spoil.</p>

<p><b>Victory at Bethsura.</b> During the following year the regent
Lysias himself gathered together a picked army of sixty thousand
infantry and five thousand horsemen and advanced against
Judas. This time the Syrians avoided the northern passes
and entered western Judah through the Valley of Elah, marched
past the old battle-fields of Socoh and Adullam, which were
now held by the Idumeans, and thence followed the road which
led along a branch of the Wady es-Sur in a southeastern direction.
By taking this southern route they reached without
opposition Bethsura,<sup><a href="#z114">(114)</a></sup> on the height which marked the southwestern
boundary of Judah, where the road from the west
joined the main highway from Hebron to Jerusalem. Rallying
ten thousand of his followers, Judas boldly attacked the huge
Syrian army in front of Bethsura and again won an overwhelming
victory.</p>

<p><b>Rededication of the Temple.</b> The retreat of their foes left
the Jews free at last to enter Jerusalem, to tear down the heathen
altar which had been reared by Antiochus, and to restore the
temple and its service. Three years after it had been desecrated
by Antiochus, the temple was rededicated. The strong
fortress of Acra within the city still remained in possession of
the Syrian garrison; but Jerusalem was fortified with high
walls and strong towers, and joy and confidence again filled the
hearts of the Jews.</p>

<p><b>Campaigns South and East of the Dead Sea.</b> Judas also
employed this brief respite from Syrian attack to carry on
campaigns against the foes who, doubtless at the instigation of
the Syrians, were attacking the Jews on every side. The first
battle was with the Idumeans and was fought at Akrabattine,
which was probably the steep Scorpion Pass at the southeastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
end of the Dead Sea, along which ran the road from Hebron to
Petra. On the east-Jordan at this time the Ammonites, under
their leader, Timotheus, apparently controlled the entire territory
from the Arnon to the Yarmuk. Judas's first east-Jordan
campaign was in the territory immediately north of the
Arnon, where he conquered the ancient city of Jazer and its
villages.</p>

<p><b>Victories in Northeastern Gilead.</b> Learning that the Jews
and descendants of the ancient Israelites settled in northern
Gilead were being besieged by Timotheus, that many others had
been massacred, and that those in Galilee were also the object of
bitter persecution, he gathered eleven thousand of his followers.
Simon, his brother, was sent with three thousand soldiers into
Galilee, where he succeeded in rescuing the Israelites and in
driving the heathen out of the uplands down to Ptolemis.
With the remaining eight thousand picked soldiers Judas and
his brother Jonathan made a rapid and brilliant campaign
through southern Gilead. A march of three days from the east-Jordan
to the northeast brought them to the borders of the
desert, where they met certain of the Nabateans, an Arabian
people who at this time were crystallizing into a strong nation,
with their centre southeast of the Dead Sea. Like Judas they
were apparently hostile to the Syrians and therefore they met
him on friendly terms. Learning through them of conditions
in Gilead, he turned suddenly northward and captured the
important trading city of Bozrah, far out in the wilderness to
the south of the Hauran. The spoils of this city provided his
followers with immediate supplies. Thence by a night march
he reached the stronghold where the Israelites were being besieged
by the Ammonites under Timotheus. In the Greek
version of I Maccabees, this stronghold is called Dathema, but
in the Syriac version Rametha, which is clearly the modern
Remtheh, an important station on the great pilgrim road to the
north, about twenty-five miles east of Bozrah. As has already
been noted, it is one of the most probable sites of the ancient
Ramoth-Gilead. Timotheus and his followers, caught unprepared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were defeated with great slaughter. From this point
Judas made a détour to the Gileadite city of Mizpah, mentioned
in the Jephthah stories. Its exact site is doubtful. It may be
identified with Sûf, the height northwest of Jerash, where are
to be found many great dolmens, or possibly it occupied the
site of Jerash itself.</p>

<p><b>Cities Captured North of the Yarmuk.</b> From here Judas
evidently marched northward across the Yarmuk to the town
of Casphor. In II Maccabees this name appears as Caspin,
and in all probability is to be identified with Castle Chisfin in
the southeastern Jaulan, a little west of the Nahr er-Rukkad.
The next town captured by Judas was Maked, which may be
represented by Tell Mikdad, about twenty miles northeast of
Chisfin and a little west of the railway from Damascus to Haifa.
Bosor without much doubt occupied the site of the modern
town of Busr el-Hariri, fifteen miles southeast of Tell Mikdad
and on the southern side of the great lava-bed, El Lejah.</p>

<p><b>The Second Victory Over Timotheus.</b> Meantime Timotheus
had gathered another army and awaited Judas near the
"brook of water opposite the town of Raphon." An echo of
the name of this ancient town is possibly to be found in the
modern El-Mezerib. The ancient village at this point, which
lay on an island in the midst of a large clear pool, from which
flows one of the chief sources of the Yarmuk, well satisfies the
situation implied by the vivid description of the battle in I
Maccabees. It was on the main highway along which Timotheus
would naturally advance from the territory of Ammon and was
about ten miles north of Remtheh, the scene of the first battle.
Timotheus's hesitation in crossing the brook was rightly interpreted
by Judas as a sign of fear. Rushing into the water the
Jews again won a complete victory. Their foes, casting aside
their weapons, fled for refuge to the ancient sanctuary of Carnaim,
which is without reasonable doubt to be identified with
the ancient shrine of Ashteroth-Karnaim, eight miles to the
north. Following the fugitives, Judas captured this city and
burned the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><b>Judas's Return.</b> Then gathering the Jews in the land of
Gilead, which in the first book of Maccabees included the
east-Jordan territory, both north and south of the Yarmuk,
Judas set out for Jerusalem. His road naturally led due
southward past the scene of his last great battle with Timotheus.
Thence, turning to the southwest, his way was through
a narrow pass where probably lay the town of Ephron. Inasmuch
as this town opposed his passage, he captured and destroyed
it. Thence passing through the ancient Arbela, he
followed the main highway that led to the Jordan opposite
Bethshean. From there he naturally followed the road along
the Jordan valley to Jericho and up to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>Significance of Judas's Victories.</b> Meantime, contrary
to his orders, two of Judas's generals had attacked the Philistine
town of Jamnia and met with a disastrous repulse. Rallying
his forces he advanced against the Idumeans to the south
and west of Judah. Hebron was taken and its citadel destroyed.
After capturing the surrounding towns he turned westward
to Marissa, the ancient Mareshah, which guarded the entrance
to the Valley of Zephathah.<sup><a href="#z108">(108)</a></sup> From there he carried his
campaign across the Philistine plain to the ancient city of
Ashdod, which he captured and looted. With a comparatively
few half-trained soldiers Judas within one year fought more
successful battles and captured more strong cities than did
David throughout all of his illustrious career. His limited
resources and the certainty of another and more overwhelming
Syrian attack made it impossible, however, for Judas to hold
the territory thus conquered, so that, while his victories represent
brilliant achievements, the effect was ephemeral. The refugees
whom he brought back to Judah increased its comparatively
small population and thus laid the foundations for that Maccabean
kingdom which ultimately rose as the result of the dauntless
and patriotic spirit that Judas infused into his followers.</p>

<p><b>Battle of Beth-zacharias.</b> Judas's desperate attempt to
capture the hostile garrison in Jerusalem led the Syrians to
send for help to Antiochus Eupator, who had succeeded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
throne of Syria on the death of his father. A vast army was
gathered, consisting of a hundred thousand infantry and twenty
thousand horsemen. Thirty-two elephants also accompanied
the army and played an important part in the final battle.
Again the approach to the Judean heights was made through
the Valley of Elah and up along the Wady es-Sur to Bethsura.
Instead of meeting the Syrians at this point Judas retired along
the northern road to Beth-zacharias, which lay on the right of
the highway a few miles southwest of Bethlehem. Here Judas
gave battle to the huge Syrian army, which was drawn up on
two wings, one on the heights and the other on the low ground.
The elephants, with towers of wood on their backs, were placed
in the front of the line of battle. Each elephant was supported
by a thousand men armed with coat of mail, and five hundred
horsemen. Judas and his followers made a courageous attack
upon this huge and imposing host, but they were overwhelmed
by sheer numbers. The elephants also were effective in turning
the tide of battle. Eleazer, one of Judas's brothers, with
the spirit that characterized the family, broke through one of
the phalanxes and, creeping under what he supposed to be the
royal elephant, pierced it with his spear from beneath and perished
under the beast as it fell to the earth. None others were
found, however, in the Jewish ranks to follow his courageous
example. Judas retired to Jerusalem, where he was besieged
by Lysias, the leader of the Syrian forces. Fortunately for
the Jewish cause, conditions in the Syrian capital made it necessary
for Lysias to retire. He accordingly made a treaty with
the Jews in which their religious freedom was fully assured on
condition that they would recognize the authority of the Syrian
kingdom.</p>

<p><b>Fortunes of Judas's Party.</b> After securing religious freedom
a strong party of the Jews, known as the Hasideans, the
forerunners of the later party of the Pharisees, were inclined to
accept peace at any cost. The result was that from this time
on Judas lost many of his followers. Even the apostate Alcimus,
appointed high priest by the Syrian king, was at first accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
by the Hasideans. His deceptions and persecution of
the faithful, however, soon drove many back into the ranks of
those who, like Judas, were struggling to gain not merely religious
freedom, but also complete political independence. In
response to the demands of the Syrian party in Judea, a certain
Nicanor, formerly master of the elephants in the Syrian army,
was sent to check the growing power of Judas and his followers.
An engagement was fought at Caphersalama, evidently
somewhere near Jerusalem. Many of the Syrian soldiers were
slain and the rest fled to the City of David, which had been,
from the days of the great Hebrew king, the designation of the
hill of Ophel, in the southeastern part of the city. It is exceedingly
probable, therefore, that Caphersalama is to be identified
with the modern Kefr Silwan,<sup><a href="#z98">(98)</a></sup> the little village on the
eastern side of the Kidron, just across the valley from the City
of David.</p>

<p><b>Victory Over Nicanor.</b> Alarmed by this victory, Nicanor
sent for another Syrian army, which he met at Beth-horon.
Thence he took the main road that leads over the pass toward
Jerusalem. Judas, with his followers, had taken his position
near the village of Adasa, at the point where the Beth-horon
road joins the central highway southward to Jerusalem. Nicanor
fell in the first charge, and his army was so demoralized
by the loss of its leader that they threw away their weapons and
fled back along the highway toward Gazara, the ancient Gezer.
The Jews in the villages along the way attacked the fleeing
Syrians with the result that none of them escaped. Profiting
by this signal victory, Judas sent an embassy to Rome. His
aim was to secure in his unequal contest with the Syrian kingdom
the aid of this power, which already was beginning to
dominate the politics of the eastern Mediterranean; but before
he could receive a reply from Rome, the Jewish champion
fought his last fatal battle.</p>

<p><b>Death of Judas.</b> After the defeat and death of Nicanor, the
Syrian king, Demetrius, sent another army into Judah. It entered
the land by the way that leads to Gilgal, which was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
either the Gilgal on the Plain of Sharon, north of Antipatris,
or else the better-known Gilgal near the ancient Shiloh.
In either case the army appears to have reached the central
plateau by the road which runs through the valley somewhat
north of the Valley of Ajalon and therefore through territory
under the control of Syria. Thence the Syrians approached
Judea and Jerusalem directly from the north. Meantime, Judas
was intrenched not far from his home at Modein. The decisive
battle was fought at Elasa, or Eleasa, a half mile north of the
steep descent from Upper to Lower Beth-horon.<sup><a href="#z84">(84)</a></sup> Terrified
by the overwhelming numbers of the Syrian army, Judas's small
force of three thousand men was soon reduced by desertion to
only eight hundred. The courageous Jewish leader made the
grave mistake of venturing a battle under these conditions.
Even as it was, he was apparently on the eve of victory when
he fell slain within the sight of the field on which he had won
his first great battle. With his fall the battle was lost and the
Syrians were left for a time in almost undisputed possession of
Judea. With great lamentation and mourning his followers
buried him in the tomb of his fathers at Modein, chanting in
modified form the words of David's lamentation over Saul:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How is the hero fallen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The saviour of Israel.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Judas's Character and Work.</b> There are many analogies
between the character and work of Saul and of Judas. Both
were devoted patriots and courageous warriors. Both laid the
foundations for a kingdom, but fell on the battle-field before
their task was completed. Both inspired their people with the
ambition for independence and taught them how to fight effectively
in securing it. Of the two, Judas appears to have been
the more balanced and unselfish character. In view of the
obstacles with which he contended, he was unquestionably the
greatest general that Israel ever produced. The peculiar topography
of Judea enabled him to contend successfully with strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
armies, but in a prolonged struggle with the Syrian kingdom the
advantages were all with the latter. The barren, limited territory
of Judea was incapable of supporting a large people or of
furnishing the resources for a protracted war. On the other
hand, Antioch, which had as its base the great plain between
the Lebanons, possessed almost unlimited resources and was
the natural centre from which to rule both Syria and Palestine.
Judas was able to win his victories not merely because of his
dauntless courage and leadership, but because the Syrian kingdom
was fatally weakened by the moral corruption and constant
dissensions of its rulers. These two elements, courageous
and able leadership on the side of the Jews and corruption and
inefficiency in the Syrian kingdom, enabled Judas's followers
in time to overcome geographical conditions and to build up,
as in the days of David, a large and independent kingdom.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>

<h3>THE MACCABEAN AND HERODIAN AGE</h3>


<p><b>Jonathan's Policy.</b> Jonathan, who succeeded his brother,
Judas, in the leadership of the Jewish rebellion, combined great
skill and energy with a certain craftiness, which enabled him
to profit by every turn in the tortuous politics of Syria. It was
an exceedingly corrupt age, and Jonathan adopted the standards
and methods of his day. The secure hiding-places in Palestine
enabled him to elude the Syrians and to recover from the shock
which his cause had received as a result of the death of Judas.
Jonathan and his followers took refuge first in the wilderness of
Judea<sup><a href="#z24">(24)</a></sup> and the dry, barren wadies that lead down to the
Dead Sea, and later in the jungle of the lower Jordan.<sup><a href="#z36">(36)</a></sup> Into
this thicket of reeds and bushes the Syrian general pursued
them. On this strange battle-field Jonathan and his followers
were defeated, but by swimming across the Jordan succeeded in
escaping pursuit. At another time he was shut up in the fortress
of Beth-basi, which Josephus identifies with Beth-hoglah,
in the midst of the Jordan valley, a little southeast of Jericho.
It is more probably to be identified with some one of the many
natural strongholds along the Wady el-Bassah, which leads
through the eastern part of the wilderness of Tekoa down toward
the Dead Sea.</p>

<p><b>Basis of Agreement With the Syrians.</b> Finding that pursuit
was futile, the Syrian general made a treaty with Jonathan,
according to which he was allowed to establish his head-quarters
at the ancient fortress of Michmash<sup><a href="#z85">(85)</a></sup> on the northern borders
of Judah and to rule in peace as a local chieftain. He in turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was to refrain from attack upon the Syrians, who were intrenched
in certain strategic strongholds. Jericho guarded the eastern
bounds of Judah. The border fortresses on the north included
Beth-horon, the ancient sanctuary of Bethel, Timnath, north of
Beth-horon, Pharathon, which is without much doubt to be identified
with Farata, southwest of Shechem, and Tephon, which
probably represents the ancient Tappuah, a little west of the
main highway that leads southward from Shechem. The western
border fortresses were Gazara in the northwest and Bethsura,
the ancient Bethzur,<sup><a href="#z114">(114)</a></sup> in the southwest.</p>

<p><b>Concessions to Jonathan.</b> As a result of the rivalry between
the different claimants for the Syrian throne, Jonathan was
suddenly raised from his position of comparative unimportance
to the virtual rulership of all southern Palestine. A certain
Alexander Balas, who claimed to be the son of Antiochus
Epiphanes, the arch persecutor of the Jews, finally gave Jonathan
the title of high priest and the control not only of Judea,
but of the Philistine coast. Jonathan, by the sword, quickly
made valid these concessions. Joppa, the natural seaport of
Jerusalem, was first seized. Then Azotus, the ancient Ashdod,
was captured after a Syrian army had been defeated on the
plain before its walls, and the famous temple of Dagon was
burned.</p>

<p><b>Jonathan's Conquests.</b> When Jonathan's patron, Alexander
Balas, was overthrown by a Ptolemy of Egypt, the Jewish leader
readily transferred his allegiance to the Syrian king, Demetrius II.
Ignoring the fact that he himself was struggling for freedom,
Jonathan disgraced the Jewish cause by sending troops to aid
this tyrant in carrying through a great massacre of his subjects
in the streets of Antioch. Already personal ambitions were
beginning to obscure the nobler patriotic ideals that had at
first actuated the warlike sons of the old priest, Mattathias. In
a short time a son of Alexander Balas appeared on the political
horizon and won the allegiance of Jonathan by granting him
control of the entire coast land from the Ladder of Tyre to the
border of Egypt. The Jewish leader improved this opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to complete the conquest of the Philistine cities and to capture
the stronghold of Bethsura. An army of Demetrius II was also
defeated on the Plain of Hazor, west of Lake Huleh. A little
later Jonathan led an army into the country of Hamath, between
the Lebanons, but met with no serious opposition. Returning
to Jerusalem, he tore down a part of the eastern wall opposite
the citadel and with the stones built a high rampart in order to
cut off the heathen garrison from all contact with the rest of
the city. Jonathan, however, soon fell a prey to craft and
treachery, which he himself had repeatedly used. Lured into
the city of Ptolemais by an ambitious general, who had placed
on the Syrian throne the young son of Alexander Balas, Jonathan
was captured and later put to death.</p>

<p><b>Simon's Achievements.</b> By this act Simon, the oldest and
most judicious of the five famous brothers, was called to the
leadership of the Jewish people. Profiting by the weakness of
Syria, he devoted himself to expanding and strengthening his
kingdom. The strong western border fortress of Gazara<sup><a href="#z61">(61)</a></sup> was
captured after a short but energetic defence. The heathen
population was expelled and Jewish colonies were settled both
here and at Joppa. Thus Simon established a direct line of
communication between Jerusalem and the Mediterranean trade
routes, and opened the way for that foreign commerce which
soon brought great wealth to the Jewish kingdom. At last, for
the first time in centuries, the citadel at Jerusalem was captured
and held by the Jews. The temple mount beside the
citadel was made stronger than before and the Jews at last felt
that sense of security which came from complete possession of
their land and of its fortified outposts.</p>

<p><b>His Strong and Prosperous Rule.</b> Simon's reign was one
of comparative peace and prosperity. A Syrian army invaded
the Philistine Plain and took their position at Kidron, which is
probably to be identified with Katrah, three and one-half miles
southwest of Ekron. Simon sent a strong army against the invaders,
under the leadership of his two oldest sons, Judas and
John. The battle was fought in the plain between Kidron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Modein. Boldly advancing to the attack the Jewish army put
the Syrians to flight, pursuing them to Kidron and the towers
near Azotus, which they quickly captured. In gratitude for
his patriotic services and beneficient rule, the Jews confirmed
Simon in the title of high priest, general, and governor. His
rule and that of his son who succeeded him were the fruitage
of the earlier struggles and the calm before the storm of foreign
invasion that before long again swept Palestine. Like his other
brothers, Simon died a violent death. He was the victim of
the treachery of one of his sons-in-law, who slew him at the
little stronghold of Dôk, in the Jordan valley, on the edge of the
western hills about three miles north of Jericho.</p>

<p><b>Growth of the Two Rival Parties.</b> Simon was followed
by his son, John Hyrcanus, who drove his father's assassin from
the land. With the military skill of his illustrious father and
uncles he combined a strong personal ambition. This is shown
not only by his conquests, but also by his employment of foreign
mercenaries. His long reign of thirty-one years witnessed
the development of the two great parties in Judaism, the Pharisees
and the Sadducees. They were the expression of the conflicting
ideas and ideals ever present in Jewish life, but now
brought into clear relief. The party of the Sadducees comprised
the high priestly nobles, whose rank, wealth, and ambitions
made them conservatives and led them to support the
political ambitions of the Maccabean kings. The Pharisees,
on the other hand, were the party of the people. They were the
strenuous champions of the law. While the question of freedom
of worship was at issue, they had upheld Judas, but they
cared little for political glory and preferred to submit to foreign
rulers rather than to fight for their independence. They
also considered it a sacrilege that warriors like John Hyrcanus
should perform the sacred high-priestly functions. Hence from
the days of John Hyrcanus the history of the Judean kingdom
was that of a house divided against itself.</p>

<p><b>Wars and Conquests of John Hyrcanus.</b> During the early
part of John's reign Judea was again invaded by the Syrians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Jerusalem was besieged and the Jews were again obliged to
recognize the old suzerainty. Fortunately for them the Syrian
king was intent upon invading Parthia and, therefore, in order
to secure the support of John Hyrcanus, left him in possession
of his kingdom. After the death of Antiochus Sidetes in this
eastern campaign, John was free to complete the conquest of
the ancient foes of his race. His first campaign was east of
the Dead Sea and resulted in the capture of the old Moabite city
of Medeba. He then marched against Shechem and Mount
Gerizim, the home of the Samaritans. Their temple was left
in ruins and their territory was joined to the Jewish kingdom.
The Idumean stronghold, Marissa,<sup><a href="#z108">(108)</a></sup> on the borders of the
Philistine Plain, and Dora, or Adora, a few miles southwest of
Hebron, were captured and the Idumeans were completely subdued.
These close kinsmen and hereditary foes of the Jews
were compelled to submit to the right of circumcision and to
accept the Hebrew laws. Thus at the point of the sword was
brought into the Jewish nation an element which was destined
in the end to prove its undoing. Last of all, Hyrcanus conquered,
by means of a protracted siege, the then Greek city of
Samaria. The Syrian army sent to its relief was vanquished
and the city completely demolished.</p>

<p><b>Reign of Aristobulus I.</b> Notwithstanding its independence
and political strength, the Jewish kingdom was at this time
largely Hellenized. Aristobulus I, the son of John Hyrcanus,
was, as his name indicates, a man strongly influenced by the
Greek culture and ideas that were pressing into Palestine from
every side. Following the example of the Greek states, he assumed
in 104 <small>B.C.</small> the title of king. His brief reign was characterized
by great brutality. His mother he allowed to starve
to death in prison, and through his insane jealousy he slew his
favorite brother. By far the most significant event of his reign
was the conquest of Galilee. Its Iturean or half-Arabian population
was assimilated to Judaism and the foundations laid
for that freer, more virile life which was the background of
early Christian history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span><b>The Cruel Rule of Alexander Janneus.</b> Alexander Janneus,
the brother who succeeded Aristobulus, was known among
the Jews as "the Thracian," and he well deserved the title.
His chief interests were war and revelry. By his rash attacks
upon the neighboring peoples he repeatedly brought disaster
upon his kingdom. He succeeded in alienating his subjects so
completely that they called in the king of Damascus to free
them from this inhuman monster. In the hour of their success,
however, they repented of their action, brought Janneus back
from the mountains whither he had fled, and restored him to
the throne. Instead of showing gratitude he hung upon crosses
eight hundred of the Pharisees who had opposed him, first
slaying their wives and children before their eyes. Notwithstanding
his rashness and his unmeasured excesses, he succeeded
by sheer persistency in extending the bounds of his kingdom,
so that at his death his authority was paramount along the
Mediterranean coast from Mount Carmel to the borders of
Egypt, in central Palestine from upper Galilee to the South
Country, and in the east-Jordan land from east of the Sea of
Galilee to the Arnon. The outlying Greek cities which he conquered
were many of them laid in ruins and the land given
up to bands of robbers. At the moment when the Maccabean
kingdom reached its widest bounds its decay had already begun
and distress was the lot of most of its citizens.</p>

<p><b>The Rivalry of Parties Under Alexandra.</b> Alexander Janneus
was succeeded by his wife Alexandra. The only other
woman who had sat on an Israelite throne was Athaliah of Judah,
although reigning queens were not uncommon in oriental
history. She reversed the policy of her husband and placed
the Pharisees, the party of the people, in control. They made
the great mistake, however, of using their power to take bloody
revenge upon their Sadducean rivals. The result was that the
fatal breach between the two parties was broadened rather than
healed. The Sadducean and military party rallied about Aristobulus,
while the Pharisees upheld the cause of Alexandra's
older son, Hyrcanus. Both of her sons were lacking in kingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
qualities. Hyrcanus was inefficient and without ambition, more
eager to enjoy a quiet life than to assume the responsibilities of
government; Aristobulus was imperious and greedy of power.</p>

<p><b>The Influence of Antipater.</b> At the death of Alexandra,
Hyrcanus was made high priest while Aristobulus II assumed
the kingship. The division was wise and equable, although in
the circumstances a permanent truce between the rival parties
was impossible. It was at this crisis that Antipater, the father
of Herod the Great, became a power in Jewish politics. Antipas,
his father, an Idumean, had been made governor of Idumea
by Alexander Janneus. Antipater was suspicious of Aristobulus
and eager to secure power at any cost. In the weak
Hyrcanus he recognized a tool adapted to his aim. Accordingly
he persuaded the high priest to flee from Jerusalem, and
enlisting the support of his friend, Aretas, the powerful Nabatean
king whose capital was at Petra, he advanced to Jerusalem
with a large army, in order to wrest the kingdom from
Aristobulus and to make Hyrcanus nominal king. In the first
engagement Aretas defeated Aristobulus, who then took refuge
with his army in the temple.</p>

<p><b>Advance of Rome.</b> It was at this juncture that Rome advanced
to the conquest of the lands along the eastern Mediterranean.
Already this growing world-power had gained possession
of Egypt and a foothold in eastern Asia Minor. In 66 <small>B.C.</small>
Pompey was sent to crush the allied rival powers of Pontus and
Armenia. After accomplishing this mission he advanced southward
toward Damascus. Already his lieutenant had ordered
the Nabatean army to leave Judea. The contest between the
two brothers, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, gave Rome, which
had already acted as a patron toward the Judean kingdom,
the desired opportunity to step in and assume control of the
much coveted territory. Again Palestine and Syria were the
bone of contention between two great world-powers. The political
horizon, however, had broadened and now the rivals were
Rome in the distant west, and Parthia, the successor of the
ancient Persian empire in the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span><b>The Appeal to Pompey.</b> The Jews had long been aware
of the importance of Rome's influence in the territory lying
along the eastern Mediterranean. It was natural, therefore,
that the claimants for the Jewish throne should refer their
case to Pompey. At Damascus representatives of the two
factions pleaded their case before him. More indicative still of
the spirit of the Jewish race was an embassy representing the
people and especially the Pharisaic party, demanding that the
claims of both the rivals be set aside, so that the Jews might
be allowed in quiet to worship their God in accordance with
their sacred laws, under the protecting rule of a foreign power.
Pompey reserved his decision until he arrived at Jerusalem.
His line of approach was apparently along the Jordan valley
past Bethshean, then known as Scythopolis, to Korea, which
Josephus describes as the "first entrance into Judea when one
passes over the midland countries." This is probably to be
identified with the modern Karawa, on the southwestern side
of the beautiful plain through which the Wady el-Farah finds
its way to the Jordan. Through this wady the highway runs
westward to what was at that time the northern boundary of
Judea. Aristobulus, anticipating that Pompey's decision would
be adverse to him, had shut himself up in the fortress of Alexandrium,
built by his father, Alexander Janneus. Apparently
this famous fortress stood on the height of Karn Sartabeh,
which rises over two thousand two hundred feet above the
Jordan valley, just south of Korea and opposite the point where
the Wady Farah enters the river. Its top is strewn to-day
with large, rough-dressed blocks of stone, which probably belonged
to the ancient castle.</p>

<p><b>Pompey's Capture of the Temple.</b> Aristobulus surrendered
when ordered to do so by Pompey, but his followers refused to
lay down arms when the Romans approached Jerusalem. Instead,
they intrenched themselves on the temple hill. Pompey,
aided by Hyrcanus and Antipater, attacked this inner fortress
from the north. The deep ravine which led up from the
Kidron and the deep cutting across the northern extension of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the temple hill made the approach, even at this, the most vulnerable
point, exceedingly difficult. By filling in the great
rock-cut fosse Pompey was able at last to bring up his battering
rams and to surmount the high walls and fortresses that were
massed at this point.</p>

<p><b>Palestine Under the Rule of Rome.</b> In the settlement
which followed the capture of Jerusalem, Pompey condemned
Aristobulus to follow the chariot as a captive in the great triumphal
procession at Rome. Hyrcanus was stripped of all
political power, but was allowed to retain his position as high
priest. Many of the Greek cities, both along the coast of the
Mediterranean and east of the Jordan, were rebuilt. All of
them were separated from Judea and placed under the immediate
direction of the Roman governor of Syria. Galilee, Judea,
and Idumea were annexed to the Roman empire, but governed
together as a sub-province. Under Gabinius, who carried out
the policy of Pompey, they were divided into five administrative
districts, with centres at Jerusalem in the south, Jericho, Amathus,
and Gadara along the Jordan valley, and Sepphoris in
Galilee.</p>

<p><b>Rebellions Led by Aristobulus and His Sons.</b> The peace
of Palestine was repeatedly disturbed by the attempts of the
survivors of the Maccabean house to recover their kingdom.
The first rebellion, in 57 <small>B.C.</small>, was led by Alexander, son of
the deposed king, Aristobulus II, about whom the Sadducean
nobility and the military class in Judea quickly rallied. He
rebuilt the fortress of Alexandrium, but his followers were
defeated by a Roman army before its walls and he was taken
prisoner. The next year Aristobulus, with his son Antigonus,
escaped from Rome and rallied his followers again at Alexandrium.
He soon, however, abandoned this stronghold for the
more inaccessible fortress of Machærus, built by his father,
Janneus, on a hill in the middle of a deep ravine which led up
on the eastern side of the Dead Sea.<sup><a href="#z38">(38)</a></sup> Being far away from
the majority of their followers and without proper equipment for
a long siege, the rebels were soon obliged to capitulate. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
third rebellion, again led by Alexander, was quickly put down
as the result of a decisive battle near Mount Tabor. For years
after, bands of robbers and rebels kept central Galilee in a
constant state of unrest, until finally the Roman general, Cassius,
subdued the country and sold thirty thousand of them into
slavery.</p>

<p><b>Antipater's Services to Rome.</b> During the two decades
that followed the Roman conquest of Palestine, Judea was
deeply affected by the great convulsions through which Rome
passed in its transition from a republican to an imperial form
of government. During this turbulent and dramatic era Antipater,
the Idumean, remained the ruling power in Judea and
profited by each change of ruler. His policy was to retain the
friendship of Rome at any cost and to ally himself with the
man of the hour. His chief aim was to further his own personal
interests. He was influenced by no patriotic zeal or racial
prejudices. At the same time he showed great skill in steering
his course amidst the storms that swept the Roman world during
these tempestuous years. When Pompey was defeated at
the battle of Pharsalia in 49 <small>B.C.</small> Antipater actively allied himself
with the cause of Julius Cæsar. When an army of the victor
marched to the conquest of Egypt he sent Jewish auxiliaries
and fought valiantly at their head, both in the siege of Pelusium
and that of Memphis. He also at a critical moment influenced
the Nabateans and the Jews of Egypt to ally themselves with
the cause of Cæsar.</p>

<p><b>Rewards for His Services.</b> As a reward for his services
Antipater was made procurator of Judea. His elder son,
Phasael was appointed governor of Jerusalem and his younger
son, Herod, of Galilee. Hyrcanus was given the title of ethnarch.
Joppa, which opened the trade of the Mediterranean to
Judea, was added to the province. The rights of the Jews in
foreign countries were also guarded by Cæsar, who always
showed himself a patron and friend of the race. His assassination
in 44 <small>B.C.</small>, and the murder of Antipater by an ambitious
Jewish noble one year later, did not undermine the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the Idumean house. Mark Antony, who was then Rome's
representative in the east, at once appointed Herod and Phasael
civil rulers of Judea to succeed their father.</p>

<p><b>The Parthian Conquest.</b> In 40 <small>B.C.</small>, however, the Parthians
for a brief time pushed the boundaries of their empire westward
to the Mediterranean and placed Antigonus, the son of
Aristobulus, on the throne of his fathers. Phasael was treacherously
put to death by the Parthians. Hyrcanus's ears
were cut off and he was carried captive to Babylon, and the
Sadducean nobles who rallied about Antigonus either slew or
drove from the land the followers of their former Idumean
rulers.</p>

<p><b>Herod Made King of the Jews.</b> Herod, after many adventures,
finally escaped to Rome, where he was given the
then empty title of "King of the Jews" at the recommendation
of Mark Antony and Octavius. After two years of active campaigning,
Herod finally captured Jerusalem, and Antigonus,
the last Maccabean king, was promptly put to death by the
Romans. In 37 <small>B.C.</small> Herod began his reign as king of the Jews.
His dominant policy, like that of his father, was loyalty at all
times and at any cost to the ruling Roman faction. Notwithstanding
faults, he proved a valuable servant of Rome. The
kingdom over which he ruled was the natural eastern boundary
of the empire. It contained many elements hostile to each
other. The Jews had proved by many rebellions how little
their loyalty to Rome could be trusted; and yet it was essential
for the integrity of the empire that the peace and strength of this
outlying province should be maintained. This task Herod was
able to accomplish. Hence, when Augustus, at the battle of
Actium in 31 <small>B.C.</small>, became master of the Roman empire, he
confirmed Herod in the authority which he had hitherto held.
Subsequently Augustus added new territory to Herod's kingdom
until, with the exception of certain Greek cities on the
coast and others east of the Jordan, he ruled over all Palestine
from the sea to the desert and from the foot of Mount Hermon
to the wilderness in the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span><b>His Policy.</b> Herod was a tyrant, merciless in putting to
death all rivals. He loaded his people with heavy taxes, but
he did give them much desired peace. Naturally in this Greek
age the son of an Idumean father and an Arabian mother was
an ardent advocate of the prevailing Hellenistic culture; yet,
with occasional lapses, Herod proved also a defender of the
Jewish race and religion.</p>

<p><b>His Work as a City Builder.</b> As a builder Herod made a
deep impression upon the Palestine of his age. After the
battle of Actium the city of Samaria had been presented to him
by Augustus. Herod transformed it into a Græco-Roman city
of the most magnificent type. Its name was changed to Sebaste,
the Greek for Augusta, in honor of his patron. On the
top of the hill was built the huge Roman temple, the ruins of
which have recently been laid bare by American excavators.<sup><a href="#z59">(59)</a></sup>
The city was encircled by a colonnade, twenty yards wide and
over a mile long, with pillars sixteen feet in height. A beautiful
natural theatre was built on the northern slope of the hill,
overlooking the fertile plain. Splendid public buildings made
it one of the glories of Herod's kingdom. He also transformed
Straton's Tower on the Mediterranean coast into a Græco-Roman
metropolis and named it Cæsarea,<sup><a href="#z115">(115)</a></sup> in honor of the
emperor. On a comparatively level plain rose a temple, theatre,
amphitheatre, and palaces of marble. Since it was intended to
be the seaport of both Samaria and Judea, a great breakwater
two hundred feet wide was constructed out of huge stones. The
harbor opened to the north, thus protecting ships from the
prevailing southwest winds. At strategic points throughout
his kingdom he fortified natural strongholds, such as the high
conical hill east of Bethlehem known as the Herodium.<sup><a href="#z86">(86)</a></sup> In
Athens and in other cities outside his kingdom Herod reared
magnificent public buildings.</p>

<p><b>Herod's Temple.</b> In many ways the crowning achievement
of Herod's zeal for building was the great temple which he
reared in Jerusalem. The temple area was first extended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>the south so that it was double its former size.<sup><a href="#z99">(99)</a></sup> A viaduct and
four gates connected it with the central and western part of the
city. Two large gateways also led up from the ancient City
of David on the south. The entire temple area was encircled
with a double row of huge marble columns. On the south side
of the court were four rows of lofty columns with Corinthian
capitals. The sanctuary itself, which stood on its original site
in the northern part of the temple area on a platform of native
rock, was surrounded by an inner group of elaborate buildings,
approached by splendid gateways on the north, east, and south.
In front of the comparatively small temple structure was reared
a large porch, one hundred cubits high and one hundred cubits
broad, which brought it into harmony with Herod's huge constructions.
The work on the temple was begun about 20 <small>B.C.</small>
Provisions were made so that it continued uninterruptedly after
Herod's death. The temple was completed only a few years
before the final destruction of Jerusalem in 70 <small>A.D.</small></p>

<p><b>The Tragedies of His Family Life.</b> The saddest chapter
in Herod's tempestuous career is that of his family life. He
was a man of strong and ungoverned passions, in whom intense
love, jealousy, and vindictiveness played a prominent rôle. He
was also the victim of the intrigues and rivalries characteristic
of an oriental harem. The story of the murder of his wife,
Mariamne, the Maccabean princess whom he truly loved, and
of his two favorite sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, as a result
of the plots of his sister, Salome, and of his treacherous
son, Antipater, is one of the familiar and most tragic chapters
in history. Conscious at last that his wife and sons had been
innocent of the base charges which led him to murder them,
betrayed by his nearest kinsmen, hated by most of his subjects,
and regarded coldly by the royal patron whom he had served
so slavishly, Herod the Great was the most pathetic figure in all
his wide kingdom.</p>

<p><b>The Popular Hopes of the Jews.</b> The victories and glories
of the Maccabean era, followed by the double tyranny of Rome
and Herod, made a profound impression upon the faith and
hopes of the Jewish race. Many of them turned with loathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
from the bloodshed and the selfish victories of the later Maccabean
rulers to the law and the worship at the temple as their chief
joy and consolation. In the minds of others these triumphs
recalled the glories of the days of David and kindled anew
their ambition to see a world-wide kingdom with Jerusalem as
its centre and a descendant of David on the throne, who should
reign, not as the corrupt, selfish Maccabean kings, but with
justice and regard for the welfare of all his subjects. Others,
more spiritually minded, like the author of chapters 37 to 70 of
the book of Enoch, looked for The Elect One, The Anointed,
The Son of Man, who would come to put an end to the reign
of the wicked, to purify the earth of all evil, to gather together
the faithful, and to establish a universal rule of righteousness.
The more bitter the tyranny of Herod and the more galling the
yoke of Rome the more ardently they hoped for the speedy
realization of these expectations, which were the solace and inspiration
of the great body of the Jewish nation. About 4 <small>B.C.</small>,
while at Jericho the tyrant lay dying who for a third of a century
had held the Jewish race powerless in his strong grasp,
a few miles away there was born one who was destined to realize,
in a manner more glorious than the most enlightened of Israel's
prophets had proclaimed, Jehovah's gracious purpose for mankind.</p>

<h2>XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE BACKGROUND OF JESUS' CHILDHOOD AND
YOUNG MANHOOD</h3>


<p><b>The Short Reign of Archelaus.</b> At his death Herod the
Great left his kingly title to his son, Archelaus. Archelaus,
however, showed himself so tyrannical and tactless in dealing
with the Jews that Augustus did not confirm his title to the
kingship, but instead made him ethnarch of Samaria, Judea,
and Idumea. During his tumultuous reign of ten years he developed
the fertile plains about Jericho by means of aqueducts,
which brought water for irrigation from the western hills, and
also built the city of Archelais on the western side of the Jordan
valley, not far from the Maccabean castle of Alexandrium.
His rule in the end proved so hateful to the Jews that they sent
a deputation of their leading men to Rome to present charges
against him. As a result, Archelaus was banished.</p>

<p><b>The Roman Province of Judea.</b> Inasmuch as Judea was
one of the border provinces and had repeatedly proved itself
turbulent and rebellious, it was placed under the immediate
direction of the emperor and was ruled by a procurator of
equestrian rank. The duties of the procurator were primarily
to maintain order, to direct the collection of taxes, and decide
the more important legal questions. He alone could inflict
capital punishment, and to him or his representatives were naturally
referred all cases in which Roman citizens were involved.
Otherwise, in Judea the administration of the civil as well as of
the ceremonial laws was in charge of the Jewish courts, at the
head of which stood the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span><b>Territory and Character of Herod Antipas.</b> To his son,
Herod Antipas, Herod the Great left Galilee and Perea. Galilee
at this time extended on the south to the River Kishon
on the Plain of Esdraelon. Its western boundaries were the
plains of Acre and Tyre. On the north it extended to the River
Litany, while its eastern boundary was the Jordan and the
Sea of Galilee. Perea was the east-Jordan territory, extending
from the territory about the Greek city of Pella in the north to
the River Arnon in the south. On the east it was bounded by
the territory belonging to the Greek cities of Philadelphia
and Gerasa. This region had been formerly occupied by the
heathen, but after conquering it the later Maccabean rulers
had settled it with Jewish colonists, so that in the Mishna it is
reckoned with Judea and Galilee as Jewish territory. Herod
Antipas, to whom these fertile provinces were assigned, inherited
the lust, the unscrupulous methods, and the building ambitions
of his father. In comparison with that of Herod the Great, his
long reign was peaceful, and while he taxed his subjects heavily
he did not interfere with their personal freedom. Sepphoris,
which was situated on a fertile hill on the southern side of the
rich plain of Buttauf, in central Galilee, was by Herod surrounded
with a wall and raised to the level of an imperial city.
Later he built Tiberias on the western side of the Sea of Galilee,
transferring thither the seat of government. It was built after
the usual plan followed in Greek cities and adorned with
splendid public buildings.</p>

<p><b>Philip's Territory.</b> The northeastern part of Herod the
Great's territory, from the foot of Mount Hermon to the upper
waters of the Yarmuk, and from the Jordan to the desert, was
given to Philip, who ruled under the title of tetrarch. He was
by far the best of Herod's sons and he devoted himself to developing
the resources of the barren territory over which he
ruled. The ancient Paneion, on the southern side of Mount
Hermon, was rebuilt and transformed into a Græco-Roman
city and made the capital of Philip's possessions. In honor of
Augustus he named it Cæsarea, and to distinguish it from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
city of the same name, built by his father, it was known as
Cæsarea Philippi. He also transformed the fishing town of
Bethsaida, on the northern side of the Sea of Galilee, into a city,
naming it Julias, in honor of the emperor's daughter.</p>

<p><b>The Decapolis.</b> One result of the Roman conquest of Palestine
was the rebuilding of the Greek cities along the Jordan
valley and eastward. Their common origin, civilization, and
interests bound them closely together, and they were known as
the Decapolis. From the days of Pompey they enjoyed special
privileges, but it is not clear that they were brought into political
union before the death of Herod in 4 <small>B.C.</small> At this time
these cities and the territory which they controlled were set aside
from the kingdom of Herod and made responsible simply to the
Roman governor of Syria. Scythopolis, commanding the great
highway from western Palestine to Gilead and the desert, was
the capital of this confederacy, although it was the only city of
the Decapolis west of the Jordan. According to Pliny, the other
cities were Hippos, Gadara, and Pella on the eastern side of the
Jordan valley, Dium, Gerasa,<sup><a href="#z45">(45)</a></sup> the modern Jerash, Raphana,
south of the Yarmuk, and Kanatha on the eastern side of the
Hauran. Here the road from Scythopolis joins the great highway
from Arabia northward to Damascus, which was the
northernmost city of the Decapolis. Later, other cities, such as
Arbela, Kanata, and Kapitolias, just south of the Yarmuk, were
added to the Decapolis until, according to Ptolemy, there were
eighteen cities thus bound together. The influence of these
flourishing, enterprising centres of Greek civilization upon the
life and thought of Galilee, and even upon Judea, cannot be
overestimated.</p>

<p><b>Place of Jesus' Birth.</b> Up to this period, most of the
events of biblical history took place in southern Palestine.
Not more than a dozen cities north of the Plain of Esdraelon
were mentioned in the preceding thousand years of Hebrew
history. Now, however, the background of biblical history is
transferred from south to north. Judah, with its narrow, rocky
valleys and shut-in views, is left behind, and Galilee, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
lofty hills, its broad open plains, and its far-extending vistas,
becomes the scene of the most important chapter in human history.
It is true that early Christian tradition points to Bethlehem<sup><a href="#z86">(86)</a></sup>
as the birthplace of Jesus. This tradition is confirmed
by Justin Martyr, who describes the scene of the birth
as in a cave near Bethlehem. Many such cave-stables are still
in use throughout the land of Palestine. For three centuries
Bethlehem lay in ruins, so that at last, when Constantine reared
the basilica which still marks the traditional site, it is doubtful
whether there was any means of determining the actual birthplace.
Beneath the church in the eastern part of the present
town there are caves, one of which may have been the scene of
the familiar story, but the misguided zeal of later generations of
Christians has surrounded it with marble and tinsel, destroying
the original simple setting.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Nazareth.</b> For twenty-seven or eight years
Nazareth was Jesus' home. Here he received those varied
influences which are reflected in his life and teaching. The
town of Nazareth<sup><a href="#z116">(116)</a></sup> lies about one thousand five hundred
feet above the level of the sea and fully a thousand above the
Plain of Esdraelon to the south. The town itself is one hundred
and forty feet below and a mile and a half back of the
southern front of the range of hills on which it rests. It stands
in the midst of an upland hollow, facing eastward. In the
spring the fields in front are green with grain, while olive trees
are scattered along the hillside up which the town climbs. The
encircling hills, however, are gray and rocky, with only meagre
suggestions of verdure, and are at present entirely denuded of
trees. Here the shepherd and the tiller of the soil lived and
worked side by side.</p>

<p><b>Its Central Position.</b> Nazareth, in ancient times, was by
no means a small, secluded town. It stood in the very heart of
lower Galilee. Nearby the great highways radiated in all directions.
From Esdraelon came one branch of the great central
highway of Palestine. Across the same plain came the main
caravan route from the east-Jordan land, from the Desert of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Arabia, and beyond. Southward past Nazareth ran two great
highways, which connected with the coast roads through Philistia
to Egypt. Westward ran a road directly to the southern
end of the Plain of Acre, following in part the line of the present
carriage road from Nazareth to Haifa. To the northwest ran
another well-travelled road, connecting at Ptolemais with the
coast road to Ph&oelig;nicia and the north. To the northeast, by way
of the Sea of Galilee and Capernaum, a branch of the main
central highway ran to Damascus. The quiet upland city,
Nazareth, was therefore peculiarly open to each of the many
varied influences that emanated from the cities and lands of
the eastern Mediterranean and from the great Græco-Roman
world across the sea.</p>

<p><b>View from the Heights Above the City.</b> Probably the
ancient city extended farther to the west, possibly climbing the
heights that overshadow the town and rise to the height of one
thousand six hundred feet above the level of the sea. Here was
spread out before the eye of the young boy of Nazareth one of the
most beautiful and significant views in all Palestine. To the
west was the Bay of Haifa and the long line of Mount Carmel
running out to the blue Mediterranean. On the southeastern
end of this massive plateau was the Place of Burning, where
Elijah appealed to the dull conscience of his nation. Below,
on the farther side of the Plain of Esdraelon, was the huge ruin
of Megiddo, beside which had been fought so many decisive
battles in Canaan's history. Directly south lay the hills of
Samaria, with the lofty height of Mount Ebal in the distance.
Standing out boldly to the southeast was the battle-field of Gilboa.
Behind it was the deep gorge of the Jordan and beyond
the lofty hills of Gilead. In the immediate foreground lay
Little Hermon, with the town of Nain on its northwestern side,<sup><a href="#z9">(9)</a></sup>
looking out upon the Plain of Esdraelon. Eastward, in the immediate
foreground from Nazareth, was the rounded, tree-clad
top of Mount Tabor. Over the hills to the northeast ran the
road to Cana and Capernaum. On the north rose the lofty
plateau of upper Galilee, and on its summit Safed, "the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
set on a hill that could not be hid." Beyond rose the cold,
snowy top of Mount Hermon. To the northwest, only five
miles away, was Sepphoris, Herod's earlier capital, the chief
stronghold of his kingdom.</p>

<p><b>The Spring at Nazareth.</b> Nazareth has but one spring,
situated on the side hill, in the eastern part of the town, probably
outside the ancient city. It leaps from the native rock a little
north of the Church of the Ascension. Thence it is conducted
to the famous Mary's Well,<sup><a href="#z117">(117)</a></sup> where the water spouts from the
wall under a covered stone arch and thence is conducted into
a great square stone trough. Here the women and children
gather to draw water to-day as they gathered in the days of
Jesus. About this ancient spring, as well as in his home, the
keen, thoughtful boy of Nazareth was able to study human
life, so that it was unnecessary that he be told what was in the
heart of man. Nazareth was so small that the character and
deeds of each of its inhabitants were like an open book, and yet
it was large and central enough to feel the pulsations of all the
great world movements.</p>

<p><b>Roads to Jerusalem.</b> From Nazareth three or four pilgrim
roads led to Jerusalem. One, apparently little used, led
westward along the eastern side of the Plain of Sharon, and
thence over the famous passes of Beth-horon to Jerusalem.
The direct but more arduous and dangerous road led due south
across the Plain of Esdraelon past Jezreel and Ginea, the ancient
En-Gannim, which stood at the point where the great
plain penetrates the Samaritan hills. Thence the main road
turned a little westward, running through Samaria and Shechem.
A more direct branch ran due south, past Sychar, joining the
other branch just east of Mount Gerizim. It was while journeying
northward along this road that Jesus paused at Jacob's
Well,<sup><a href="#z17">(17,</a> <a href="#z18">18)</a></sup> on the eastern side of the fertile plain that opens to
the northeast of Mount Gerizim, and conversed with the woman
of Sychar, who perhaps had been working in the fields near by.
The third pilgrim road from Nazareth ran from Jezreel eastward
along the plain to the Jordan valley. From there it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
possible either to take the more direct route on the west side
of the valley or to cross the river at the famous fords opposite
Scythopolis and thence to follow the highway along the eastern
side of the Jordan. This eastern route was on the whole more
attractive and lay in the territory of Antipas, beyond the reach of
the hostile Samaritans. From Jericho a road led through the
barren, waterless, robber-infested wilderness of Judea, that suggested
to the Great Teacher his parable of the Good Samaritan.</p>

<p><b>Jesus' Educational Opportunities.</b> Along the central or
the east-Jordan route travelled the young boy of twelve to participate
for the first time in the worship of the temple and to
ask of the great teachers of his race the eager questions which
aroused their wonderment. Luke has told in clear and graphic
words the history of these earlier years: "The child grew, and
became strong, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was
upon him." The light that comes from the study of Jesus'
geographical environment richly supplements the meagre biblical
narrative. Every year his parents made the journey to
Jerusalem and Jesus doubtless went with them. The same
highways frequently brought to Nazareth itinerant scribes and
teachers of the law. Ample opportunities were also offered to
secure copies of the scriptures of his race and thus to acquire
that intimate knowledge of their contents which Jesus showed
throughout all his ministry. Above all, Nazareth was in close
touch with the outside world and revealed to Jesus the crying
needs of the "lost sheep of the House of Israel," which ultimately
drew him from the seclusion of his home to undertake his great
life work.</p>

<p><b>Scene of John the Baptist's Early Life.</b> John the Baptist
is one of the most meteoric characters in biblical history.
Only one scene in his life can be identified with certainty, and
that is the grim castle beside the Dead Sea, where he fell a
victim to Herod's passion and fear. Apparently a large part of
his early life was spent at or near Jerusalem, where his father
ministered as priest and where he was able to observe the crimes
of the people, against which he later so vehemently and effectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
protested. The wild, treeless wilderness that runs up from the
Dead Sea almost to the gates of Jerusalem furnished a fitting
setting for this stern prophet of righteousness, this herald of a
new order. Here, undisturbed by the distracting life of the
city, he could effectively deliver his message to the thoughtful
ones who sought him in his solitude.<sup><a href="#z24">(24)</a>)</sup> Here also dwelt that
peculiar Jewish sect, the Essenes, whose ascetic life and strict
ceremonial régime were an extreme protest against the corrupt
Hellenizing tendencies of the day.</p>

<p><b>Field of His Activity.</b> Like the early Hebrew prophets,
whom John so closely resembled, he also sought out the places
where men could be found in great numbers. The later Maccabean
rulers and Herod transformed the hitherto comparatively
deserted valley of the lower Jordan into fruitful fields, irrigated
by the brooks from the hillside, studded with prosperous
villages and guarded with mighty strongholds. The Jordan
valley, which touched all the Jewish parts of Palestine&mdash;Judea
itself, Perea, Samaria, and Galilee&mdash;was the chief field of John's
work. Bethabara (House of the Ford) has been generally identified
with the famous ford called Abarah, opposite Scythopolis.
The best Greek manuscripts, however, read "Bethany beyond
the Jordan." It is doubtful whether John's work extended so
far north as the Decapolis. It is exceedingly probable that the
variant readings are due to a confusion of the original, which
read Beth Nimrah, which is represented by Tell Nimrin beyond
the Jordan northeast of Jericho, at the point where the Wady
Nimrin breaks through the Gileadite hills. It was evidently
an important town, commanding the road which leads inland
from this point and was within the field of John's activity.</p>

<p><b>The Baptism of Jesus.</b> If so, the ford where Jesus met
and was baptized by John was probably a little northeast of
Jericho, just below the point where the Wady Nimrin joins the
Jordan, rather than farther south at the traditional scene of the
baptism.<sup><a href="#z118">(118)</a></sup> In any case, it is easy to picture the coffee-colored
stream pausing in its tempestuous course just before it enters
the Dead Sea. A thicket of bushes and overhanging trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
shut in the view on either side, making a strange but fitting
sanctuary for the meeting of the fearless prophet and the disciple
from distant Nazareth, who had doubtless come, attracted
by the rumors regarding his work and words. Whether John
knew it or not, that moment marked the culmination of his own
life task. To Jesus it meant the consecration of himself not
only to that for which John stood, but also to that vastly larger,
broader task that had been revealed to him in the quiet years
at Nazareth. His act, simple yet profoundly significant, brought
to Jesus a full divine assurance of God's approval. He was
yet to find the place, men, and means with which to work, but
henceforth he was completely committed to his task. The biblical
narrative implies that after this wonderful meeting with
John there came to Jesus, as at frequent times in his ministry,
a great reaction. He was led to seek the solitude of the wilderness
west of the Jordan, there to battle with the temptations
that assailed him, there to win the surpassing peace and poise
that characterized his acts and words in all the great crises of
his ministry.</p>

<p><b>Machærus Where John Was Beheaded.</b> The Synoptic
Gospels, as well as the Fourth, imply that for a brief period
Jesus took up the message and adopted the methods of John,
preaching with great success among the country villages of
Judah. His work appears to have been brought to a sudden
end by the arrest of John, whose fearless denunciation of
Herod's crime in putting away his own wife, the daughter of
Aretas, had aroused the resentful hatred of Herod and of
Herodias, the partner in his guilt. In keeping with the methods
of the age, John was seized and imprisoned at Herod's most
distant fortress, Machærus,<sup><a href="#z38">(38)</a></sup> which lay three thousand and
seventy feet above the sea, on the top of a long flat ridge running
for more than a mile from east to west. According to Pliny,
it was, next to Jerusalem, the strongest fortress in the land.
It had been reared by Herod the Great in the place of the old
Maccabean stronghold. In the centre of it was an impregnable
citadel. The encircling wall, one hundred yards in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
can still be traced. The interior is singularly bare, but a
very deep well and two dark dungeons remain. Apparently
Herod the Great also built a strong Roman city at the head of
this valley. It rested like a swallow's nest on the lofty edge
of the Moabite plateau. Acres of hewn stone with crumbling
walls testify to its size and strength. In the centre are the
ruins of a huge palace or castle about two hundred feet long and
a hundred and fifty feet wide, with traces of rounded towers.
Several passages lead to underground cisterns and dungeons,
suggesting that this may have been the castle of Herod Antipas,
beneath which John the Baptist was confined. Either here or in
the citadel farther down the valley the intrepid prophet spent
his last days. In this sinister spot, associated as it was with
Alexander Janneus, Herod the Great, and his son Antipas, John
the Baptist was beheaded.</p>

<p><b>Effect of John's Imprisonment Upon Jesus.</b> The news of
John's imprisonment evidently made a deep impression upon
Jesus. It led him to change the scene and method of his work.
He left Judea, with its harsh scenery and narrow life, and returned
to the simpler and more joyous scenes in Galilee. He still continued
in part to preach, but more and more he devoted himself
to the task of the teacher and sought to draw from the
multitudes that gathered about him certain disciples who would
stand in closest personal touch with him and embody in their
lives and teachings the message which he wished to impart to
his race.</p>

<p><b>Jesus' Appearance.</b> The gospels record the inner spiritual
growth of the divine Son of God; but the environment amidst
which he lived suggests the nature of his physical development.
Nazareth is still famous for its attractive, wholesome type of
men and women. Its wholesome surroundings, soil, and air
all make for perfect health. The artists of the Middle Ages had
no basis other than their morbid religious fancies in painting
their grotesque pictures of the Christ. Constant exposure to
the hot oriental suns meant that his complexion was deeply
browned. The out-door life among the Galilean hills meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that he was probably tall in stature; his labors and long journeys
reveal great strength of muscle. He probably had the thin
nostrils and lustrous eyes that still characterize the pure Semitic
type. The impression which he made at first glance upon all
whom he met indicates that his was a perfect physical development.
Had he permitted the enthusiastic multitudes that followed
him to proclaim him king he would indeed have graced a
throne. Through his mien and bearing was revealed the serene
heart, in perfect harmony with the Divine Father and throbbing
in sympathy with the needs and aspirations of all mankind.
Thus there is every reason to believe that Jesus was in body,
as well as in mind and in soul, the supreme and culminating
product of God's creative work.</p>

<h2>XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE SCENES OF JESUS' MINISTRY</h3>


<p><b>Why Jesus Made Capernaum His Home.</b> At the beginning
of his Galilean ministry Jesus transferred his home, as well as
the scene of his work, from Nazareth to Capernaum. The
choice of this city reveals the breadth of his purpose. Capernaum
was the commercial metropolis of northern Palestine.
Here converged the great highways from Egypt, central Palestine,
Gilead, and Arabia on the south, which in turn led to
Ph&oelig;nicia, northern Syria, Damascus, and Babylonia. Although
it was a strongly Jewish town, its population was necessarily
cosmopolitan. Many different occupations were here represented.
The fish that were caught, especially in the northern
part of the lake, were famous throughout Galilee. The basaltic,
well-watered plains about the northern end of the Sea of Galilee
bore rich crops of grain; while on the rocky but fertile hills
shepherds pastured their flocks. The position of the town also
made it an important commercial centre. Roman tax collectors
and centurions made it their head-quarters. Thus Capernaum
was an epitome of the varied life of Galilee. Teachings implanted
at this strategic point would also quickly spread in all
directions along the eastern Mediterranean seaboard.</p>

<p><b>Site of Capernaum: Archæological Evidence.</b> The exact
situation of Capernaum has been the subject of long dispute.
The two rival sites are (1) Tell Hum, at the northern end of the
Sea of Galilee, and (2) Khan Minyeh, or the neighboring hill
known as Tell Oreimeh on the northwestern side of the lake.<sup><a href="#z33">(33)</a></sup>
Although extensive excavations have not yet been conducted
at these points, the archæological evidence thus far discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
points clearly to Tell Hum as the site of Capernaum. On the
top of Tell Oreimeh, which rises about two hundred and forty
feet above the level of the lake, are the ruins of an old Amorite
town. At this point, however, as well as at Khan Minyeh and
in the neighboring plain, not a single trace of Roman ruins can
be discovered. At Khurbet Minyeh, farther north, near the
shore of the lake, are the extensive ruins of a large Arab town
which flourished during the Middle Ages. In the absence of
any trace of Roman ruins it is incredible that the great metropolis
of Capernaum could ever have occupied this site.</p>

<p><b>Ruins at Tell Hum.</b> Tell Hum, on the contrary, is the centre
of a vast area of ruins which come from the Roman and
Arabic period, and clearly was once the site of a huge city.<sup><a href="#z119">(119)</a></sup>
Great, black, basaltic blocks are strewn in every direction, with
occasional fragments of capitals and columns of white limestone.
In the neighboring valley is an extensive Roman necropolis,
which is itself clear evidence that near by was once a great
and flourishing city. In the centre of these ruins are the remains
of the largest synagogue thus far discovered in Galilee.
It was built of white limestone and lavishly decorated. Of the
many artistic figures which were thus employed the seven-branched
candlestick, palms, and vines are distinctively Jewish.
The foundations and many of the fallen pillars of this noble
structure still remain, and are jealously guarded by the Franciscan
monks, who have surrounded the whole by a high, enclosing
wall. The synagogue evidently faced the lake. In
front was a raised pavement, to which steps led up from the
east and west. Like most of the synagogues of Galilee, it was
entered by three doors, of which the central was six feet in width
and those on the sides four and a half feet. The synagogue
itself was seventy-eight feet long and fifty-nine feet wide. The
inner court was surrounded on three sides by rows of columns
on which rested an upper gallery. The synagogue of which the
ruins survive probably dates from the second Christian century,
but there are distinct indications that it stood on the site of
an older building. This older synagogue was in all probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the one so frequently mentioned in the Gospel narratives (cf.
Mk. 1:21-27, Lk. 7:1-10, 8:41, Mt. 12:10-13).</p>

<p><b>Testimony of the Gospels and Josephus.</b> The parallel
passages in John 6:17 and Matthew 14:34 clearly imply that Capernaum
was on the northern border of the Plain of Gennesaret.
By many scholars this has been recorded as decisive evidence
that the city, which was the scene of the greater part of Jesus'
ministry, was at Khan Minyeh or Tell Oreimeh, which lie in
the northern part of the Plain of Gennesaret. A reference in
Josephus, however, leaves little doubt that during the first
Christian century the term Gennesaret included the low-lying
territory to the northeast of Tell Oreimeh, which rises in the
midst of the plain, and that its northeastern end was the famous
spring Of Tabighah<sup><a href="#z120">(120)</a></sup> which bursts from the hillside at the
point where the northern hills descend close to the lake. After
describing the marvellous fertility of the Plain of Gennesaret
Josephus says: "For besides the good temperature of the air,
it is also watered from a most fertile fountain. The people
call it Capernaum. Some have thought it to be a vein of the
Nile because it produces the coracin fish (the catfish) as well as
that lake which is near Alexandria." During the Arab occupation
this spring was enclosed in an octagonal basin which keeps
out the catfish that abound in all the inlets on the northwestern
side of the lake and originally were doubtless found in this copious
fountain, as is stated by Josephus (<i>cf.</i> Masterman, <i>Studies
in Galilee</i>, 80). His statement also implies that the Roman city
of Capernaum extended westward to the fountain Tabighah
on the border of the Plain of Gennesaret. In his <i>Life</i> (§ 72)
Josephus also tells of his being wounded in a skirmish near
Bethsaida Julias, east of the Jordan. From there he was "carried
into a village named Capharnome." This reference points
clearly to Tell Hum, only four miles from Bethsaida Julias, as
the site of Capernaum, rather than to Khan Minyeh, two and
a half miles further west on the same road.</p>

<p><b>Statements of Early Pilgrims.</b> The first Christian pilgrim
to give an account of Capernaum is Bishop Arculf who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
visited this region about 670 <small>A.D.</small> Proceeding from Tiberias, he
crossed the Plain of Gennesaret, and from a hill near the spring
Tabighah he viewed Capernaum, which he thus describes: "It
had no wall, and being confined to a narrow space between
the mountain and lake, it extended a long way upon the shore
from west to east, having the mountain on the north and a lake
on the south." The description, while general, accords perfectly
with the peculiar topography of the northern end of the Sea of
Galilee. Near the spring Tabighah the hills come close to
the shore, and then eastward gradually recede, leaving a narrow
but ever-widening strip of land which extends northeastward
for two miles to Tell Hum. Inasmuch as the inhabitants of
Capernaum drew their water supply from the lake and were
chiefly engaged in commerce and fishing or else in cultivating
the rich fields of black, basaltic earth which sloped northward
from the town, it was natural that the town should extend for
at least two miles along the shore. Later Christian pilgrims
echo the same testimony regarding the site of Capernaum.
The Dominican monk, Burkhard, at the close of the thirteenth
century, in describing the fountain Tabighah says: "Josephus
calls this fountain Capernaum because the whole land from the
fountain to the Jordan&mdash;a distance of two hours&mdash;belonged to
Capernaum." Not until the seventeenth century was it suggested
that the ancient site was situated at Khan Minyeh instead
of on the northern side of the lake. This identification by
a certain Quaresmius was apparently due to the extensive ruins
of the large Arab town that flourished there during the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p><b>Site of Chorazin.</b> Two miles north of Tell Hum, beside a
wild, volcanic gorge, on a rocky bluff about eighty feet high,
that projects far out into the valley, are the remains of another
Roman town which bears to-day the name Kerazeh. This is the
Arabic equivalent of the biblical Chorazin.<sup><a href="#z121">(121)</a></sup> This site agrees
with Jerome's statement that Chorazin was two miles from
Capernaum. Although it was not directly on the Sea of Galilee,
as his description implies, it commanded from certain points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
a view of the lake which lay below. The ruins of the ancient
town are scattered over several acres, and indicate that Chorazin
was probably once as large as Capernaum. Its chief public
building was also a synagogue, seventy-four feet long and
forty-nine feet wide, and entered by a triple gateway. Its Corinthian
columns were elaborately decorated, in a style that suggests
that it comes from a period not earlier than the second
Christian century. Like that at Capernaum, it probably stands
on the site of the older synagogue in which Jesus taught the
Jewish inhabitants of this retired Roman city. The remains
of olive presses indicate that the town was once encircled by
olive groves. Near by are also fields, the rich, basaltic soil of
which doubtless bore the superior quality of wheat for which,
according to the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Menahoth</i> 85 A), Chorazin
was famous.</p>

<p><b>Bethsaida.</b> Bethsaida, which also witnessed many of Jesus'
mighty works, was, according to Pliny and Jerome, on the east
of the Jordan. Here Jesus retired from the territory of Herod
Antipas when the news came of the death of John the Baptist.
The town was situated immediately east of the point where
the Jordan enters the delta through which it discharges its
waters into the Sea of Galilee.<sup><a href="#z122">(122)</a></sup> Philip, the son of Herod the
Great, rebuilt and transformed it into a Greek city, giving it
the name Julias in honor of the daughter of his patron Augustus.
It is represented to-day by the ruins known as Et-Tell. The
site was well chosen. To the south is the rich, alluvial plain
made by the delta of the Jordan. It rested on a rounded hill
which rose fifty or sixty feet above the plain. Extensive Roman
ruins reveal the importance of this southern metropolis of
Philip's territory.</p>

<p><b>Probable Scene of the Feeding of the Multitudes.</b> At
this secluded point, which commanded a marvellous view of the
Sea of Galilee to the south, lived three of Jesus' disciples, Andrew,
Peter, and Philip. The waters of the lake immediately
below the delta are still the best fishing grounds<sup><a href="#z123">(123)</a></sup> in all the
Sea of Galilee. Eastward and northward of the Jordan delta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
is a wealth of grass which covers the rich plain and runs up the
slopes of the eastern hills. This point, which was a lonely
place beyond the limits of the city, fully accords with the statement
of the Fourth Gospel, "Now there was much grass in
this place." Although early Christian tradition fixes the scene
of the feeding of the multitudes on the northern borders of the
Plain of Gennesaret, it is probable that here on the northeastern
side of the sea Jesus, undisturbed, was able to teach the multitudes
and to satisfy their great spiritual as well as physical
needs.</p>

<p><b>The Night Voyage of the Disciples</b>. The evidence that
there was a Bethsaida west of the Jordan breaks down on close
examination. The crucial passage, Mark 6:45, which states that
after feeding the multitude Jesus told his disciples to cross over
in advance to Bethsaida, would perhaps mean that they were
simply to go in the direction of Bethsaida. The continuation
of the narrative in Mark, as well as the parallel passage in
Matthew 14:34, states that they crossed over and landed on the
Plain of Gennesaret, while John 6:17 adds that their destination
was Capernaum. The physical characteristics of the northern
end of the Sea of Galilee throw much light upon the night voyage
of the disciples. The actual distance from the lonely spot southeast
of Bethsaida to Capernaum was only about six miles. Their
course was almost due westward toward the point where the
Plain of Gennesaret and the wadies behind lead to the heights
of upper Galilee. Through this open gateway sudden wind
storms rushed down across the lake with terrific violence.
While we were riding by this spot one beautiful day in March
a storm of this kind suddenly swept down across the valley near
Khan Minyeh, transforming the placid lake into a mass of windswept
waves and compelling some men in a sail-boat to lower
their sails and drive before the storm. Even the members of
our own party had difficulty for a time in keeping in the saddles,
so fierce was the wind, although at the same time the southern
part of the lake was almost undisturbed. Against such a western
gale the weary disciples struggled all night until morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
At last, as the Fourth Gospel states, Jesus, ever solicitous for
the welfare of his friends, came out to meet them as they were
near to the land.</p>

<p><b>Places Where Jesus Taught His Disciples.</b> On the
southern side of the Plain of Gennesaret, where one of the
streams that waters the plain flows into the sea, was the little
town of Magdala, under the shadow of the bluffs that come close
to the shore on the south.<sup><a href="#z33">(33)</a></sup> It was a walk of only four or five
miles from Jesus' home at Capernaum. A little east of the road
which ran from Capernaum to Nazareth were the rounded,
treeless heights known as the Horns of Hattin, where, according
to tradition, Jesus sat down and taught his disciples the great
truths contained in the Sermon on the Mount. To the north
and west of Capernaum are many quiet heights commanding
exquisitely beautiful views across the sea below. To these
Jesus doubtless often retired, sometimes accompanied by his
disciples. The earliest Christian tradition (that of Arculf, about
670 <small>A.D.</small>) fixed the scene of the giving of the Beatitudes and
of the Sermon on the Mount on the top of the hill at the end of
the wady that leads up to the north of the famous fountain of
Tabighah.<sup><a href="#z129">(129)</a></sup> Eugesippus writing in the twelfth century says
that "the descent of the mountain where our Lord preached to
the multitude was two miles from Capernaum," thus confirming
the older identification with the central, commanding, and yet
secluded site near the city that witnessed most of Jesus' teaching
and work. It would appear that (as Dr. Masterman urges
in his <i>Studies in Galilee</i>, 87) the difficulties which later prevented
pilgrims from reaching the northern shores of the Sea
of Galilee led them to transfer the traditional site of the "Mount
of Beatitudes" to the Horns of Hattin nearer Tiberias. Along
the northern shore of the sea are also two or three picturesque
bays with the land sloping gradually upward like an amphitheatre.
Here it requires little imagination to see Jesus sitting
in the boat with his disciples, surrounded by attentive crowds.
These quiet spots, apart from the city, were of profound significance
in Jesus' ministry, for his great work was that of a teacher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and they afforded the needed opportunity for quiet conversation,
for question and answer, and for that intimate personal
touch which was the secret of the Master's power.</p>

<p><b>Northern End of the Sea of Galilee.</b> Jesus' active ministry
was performed almost entirely about the northern end
of the Sea of Galilee and was limited to a radius of four or five
miles with its centre at Capernaum. This fact shows convincingly
that Jesus' method of work was intensive rather than extensive.
To-day the sadness of the lament which he uttered
over Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida still overshadows
this most beautiful but loneliest spot in all Palestine. Save a
few monks who live at Tell Hum, each of these sites is almost
absolutely deserted. A hush seems to rest upon the whole
land. The traveller often goes for miles without meeting a
human being. Only occasionally are sails seen upon the northern
end of the lake. It is like an ancient ruined temple, whose
sacred memories and associations are undisturbed by the footfall
or voice of man.</p>

<p><b>Contrast Between the Northern and Southern End.</b> On
the other hand, the southern end of the lake has already felt
the touch of the modern commercial world. Tiberias, on the
southwestern side, has a population of over five thousand, of
which two-thirds are Jews. At Semakh, on the southern point
of the lake, the railroad from Haifa to Damascus has a station
and is rapidly bringing in not only the tourists, but the
products and life of the outside world. In the time of Jesus
also the Græco-Roman world had largely taken possession of the
southern end of the Sea of Galilee. Tiberias, the city of Herod
Antipas, was either completed or else in the process of building.
The site of Tarichea, whose name suggests its Greek characteristics,
was at Kerak, on the southwestern end of the lake. Across,
on the heights opposite Tiberias, was the thoroughly Greek city
of Hippos, already reckoned as one of the Decapolis. To the
southwest, on the bold bluff two thousand feet above the Sea of
Galilee, lay the splendid city of Gadara. Its great theatre and
acropolis commanded a magnificent view of the sea. Along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the height to the west of the city ran the paved Roman highway
with its row of columns, flanked on either side by magnificent
villas. Still farther west, looking down toward the sea, were
the tombs of the rich citizens.</p>

<p><b>Jesus' Visit to the Gadarene Territory.</b> Only once is it
recorded that Jesus left the Jewish atmosphere that characterized
the northern end of the sea to enter the Greek world so near
at hand. The exact scene of his healing of the demoniac was
apparently uncertain even in the minds of the Gospel writers.
It is sometimes described as the land of the Gadarenes and it
is exceedingly probable that at this time the authority of the
powerful city of Gadara extended along the eastern border of
the lake which lay only six miles away. Josephus, in his <i>Life</i>
(9:10), refers to certain Gadarene villages close to the shore. On
the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee the hills recede at every
point from a quarter to a half mile from shore, except at one
point across the lake from Tiberias. There the hills approach
within forty or fifty feet of the shore, and slope abruptly to the
water, making it easy for a frightened herd of swine to plunge
headlong over the steep place referred to in the Gospel narrative.
Gerasa, from which is derived the other designation of
the region (Land of the Gerasenes), is without much doubt represented
by the ruins of Kursi or Kersa, on the left bank of the
Wady Semakh, about a mile from the sea.<sup><a href="#z32">(32)</a></sup> The ruins indicate
that it was a small village, surrounded by a wall three feet in
thickness. The ruins also extend outside the walls toward the
lake. On the hillsides which rise immediately above the town
are ancient tombs. Here Jesus probably met the maniac whose
belief that he was possessed of a legion of demons reflected the
strong Roman environment in which he lived.</p>

<p><b>The Great Crisis in Jesus' Ministry.</b> The Gospel narratives
are so fragmentary and the topographical evidence is so
meagre that it is impossible to trace with any degree of assurance
Jesus' various journeys. Once, and possibly often, he visited
his kinsmen at his native town of Nazareth, following the well-beaten
highway along the lake to Magdala and thence past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the village of Hattin to Nazareth. From the cities on the northern
end of the Sea of Galilee, which were the scenes of his public
ministry, the rumor of his work spread in all directions and
multitudes came streaming to him from Galilee, Judea, the cities
of the Decapolis and even distant Ph&oelig;nicia. It soon became
evident, however, that the majority came merely to be healed,
or attracted by the hope that he was the Messiah of the popular
expectation. To such his strong ethical message was a disappointment.
They represented the stony or shallow ground
of the familiar parable, and, therefore, in their lives the seed
which he sowed bore no fruit. Scribes sent by the Jewish
hierarchy at Jerusalem also came to entrap him with questions
and to stir up distrust and opposition even in the ranks
of his disciples. Thus he suddenly found himself surrounded
not by enthusiastic multitudes but by suspicious, relentless
foes.</p>

<p><b>Journey to Ph&oelig;nicia.</b> This great crisis marks an important
turning-point in Jesus' ministry. Influenced by the
evidences of the loss of public favor and of the open opposition
of the Pharisees, he withdrew from public activity in Galilee
and devoted himself more and more to the instruction and
training of his disciples. Through them he realized that he
was to accomplish his divine mission. On one occasion he
departed with his disciples to the borders of Tyre and Sidon.
It was a circuitous journey through the lofty, picturesque valleys
of upper Galilee, down toward the fertile, warm plains of
Ph&oelig;nicia. The biblical narrative indicates that he did not
enter the ancient city of Tyre, but proceeded northward, probably
along the great coast road that ran through Sarepta and
Sidon. At this time both of these cities were important commercial
centres. Sidon lay on a promontory jutting out into
the Mediterranean, with shallow, sandy harbors both on the
north and on the south. The fertile fields and groves that encircled
this northern metropolis, and its warm, sunny climate
doubtless reminded Jesus and his disciples of their home at
Capernaum. The Gospel narrative also implies that Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
returned to Bethsaida through the Greek towns east of the
Jordan, thus completely avoiding the territory of Antipas.</p>

<p><b>At Cæsarea Philippi.</b> Soon after, or possibly in connection
with the same journey, Jesus visited Philip's capital at
Cæsarea.<sup><a href="#z30">(30)</a></sup> It lay at the head of the Jordan valley, on the highway
from northern Palestine to Damascus. About were picturesque
hills, covered with poplars, oaks, and evergreens, and
fertile gardens watered by the many streams that sprang from
the base of Mount Hermon. The Roman town was situated
on a triangular terrace, with the present Wady Hashabeh on the
north and the Wady Zaareh on the south. On the east there
was also a protecting moat, while the inner city was surrounded
by thick walls and guarded by towers. It was not within this
heathen city, but on the quiet hilltops and the spurs of Mount
Hermon that rise to the north of the town, that Jesus found the
refuge and quiet which he sought. Here, away from the Judean
multitudes and the popular hopes of a temporal Messiah, Jesus
told his disciples that he must accomplish his mission not by the
sword or with the outward signs of triumph, but through suffering,
ignominy, and death. Here, therefore, is to be sought the scene
of that transfiguration which was so closely connected with his
announcement to his disciples of the supreme sacrifice which
he was about to make and which revealed to them his true
character.</p>

<p><b>The Journey Southward from Galilee.</b> From Luke 13:31
it is clear that at this period Herod Antipas was endeavoring
to put Jesus to death, even as he had John the Baptist. This
fact doubtless explains why Jesus avoided the territory of
Antipas, preferring, as he himself implies, to end his work in
Jerusalem rather than in some gloomy fortress like that of
Machærus (Luke 13:33, 34). Hence, as he returned southward
from Cæsarea Philippi, passing through Galilee, probably along
the western side of the lake or by boat to the southern end,
he was careful "that no man should know it" (Mark 9:30). The
most direct route from Capernaum to Jerusalem was down the
western side of the Jordan valley. Luke 17:11 states that on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
way he passed along the borders of Samaria and Galilee. It
was probably in one of the little villages not far from Scythopolis
that the ten lepers sought his help. From Luke 9:51-56 it appears
that he first planned to pass thence through Samaria, probably
by the road that ran through Teiasir and Tubas and joined the
main central highway near Sychar (<i>cf.</i> p. 80); but the inhospitable
reception accorded him by the Samaritans evidently
led him to avoid this road and keep instead to the Jordan
valley. Mark 10:1 indicates that he followed the east-Jordan
highway. This road took him into the territory of Perea,
which was under the control of Herod Antipas, but at a distance
from his capital. Here, in the field of John the Baptist's activity
and near the scene of Jesus' early work, the people again
rallied about him in great numbers.</p>

<p><b>At Jericho.</b> The multitudes still followed Jesus after he
had crossed the Jordan on his way to Jerusalem. The Gospel
narratives have given two vivid pictures, one of the blind men
who sat by the way as he passed along, and the other of Zaccheus,
the prominent tax-collector. The Herodian Jericho evidently
lay on both sides of the Wady Kelt, whose waters irrigated
the city and its fertile gardens that extended far across the
level plain.<sup><a href="#z35">(35)</a></sup> The ancient ruins indicate that the larger portion
of the Roman city lay on the southern side of the Kelt;
but its suburbs extended northward to a point east of the older
Jericho, which lay near the western hills. The plains about
the Roman Jericho were probably cultivated for miles in each
direction. Here the date-palms grew in great profusion and
their fruit was one of the chief exports of the place. Strabo
states that balsam was produced here in large quantities. In
summer the climate was exceedingly hot and oppressive, but in
winter it was balmy and equable. Josephus describes with unwonted
enthusiasm its marvellous fertility and healthful climate
(<i>Jew. Wars</i>, IV, 8:2, 3). Through it ran the great caravan road to
Gilead and the desert. It was the eastern outpost of Judea.
The collection of customs at this point was, therefore, of great
importance. The city was as different from the other cities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Judah as was its physical environment. Plenty, luxury, and
corruption were its chief characteristics. It was the heir of the
traditions of the ancient Canaanite cities of the plain. Its
immediate associations were with Herod the Great, Cleopatra,
and Archelaus, three of the most sinister characters of this
corrupt age.</p>

<p><b>Situation of Bethany.</b> From Jericho the road led up
through the barren wilderness of Judea<sup><a href="#z25">(25)</a></sup> to Jerusalem. It
was an almost steady climb of three thousand feet. Probably
Herod the Great had already joined these two important cities
of his empire by a Roman road, following the general course
along which runs the modern carriage road. In striking contrast
to the barrenness of the brown, rocky wilderness is the
lofty plateau which stands at the top of the final ascent. On
this southeastern spur of the Mount of Olives lay the little
town of Bethany.<sup><a href="#z124">(124)</a></sup> It was surrounded by small, rock-strewn
grain fields and stood in a bower of fig, almond, and olive trees.
To the northwest rose the higher ridges of the Mount of Olives,
shutting off the view of Jerusalem. Above was probably situated
the little village of Bethphage, less than a mile away and
closely associated with Bethany in the minds of the Gospel
writers. The view to the east was through the broad hollow
down which went the road to Jericho. To the southeast the eye
looked beyond the barren hills of the Judean wilderness to the
Dead Sea and the lofty line of the plateau of Moab.<sup><a href="#z24">(24)</a></sup> It is
significant that Jesus chose this village as his home while in
Judea, for it was retired, yet near to Jerusalem and one of the
few places that commanded a wide outlook. This fact suggests
the impression which Jerusalem made upon the mind of the
great Prophet of Nazareth. Shut in by its surrounding hills
and by its narrow fanaticism and ceremonialism its atmosphere
must have seemed to him stifling.</p>

<p><b>The Triumphal Entrance Into Jerusalem.</b> Near Bethany,
his southern home, where Jesus apparently spent many days,
he secured the ass on which he made his memorable journey
to Jerusalem. The occasion was the Passover Feast, and pilgrims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
from Perea, Galilee, and eastern Judea, the fields in
which his ministry had been performed, accompanied him on
the journey. As they saw him riding on an ass, the royal beast
in the days of David, the earlier hopes of the people were suddenly
revived. Quickly the news of his presence spread through
the long line of pilgrims. Those ahead tore branches from the
trees by the wayside or else spread their garments in the way
along which he was to pass, while they all joined in a triumphant
song suggested by Psalm 118:25, 26:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hosanna to the son of David!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hosanna in the highest!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Slowly the procession wound around the southern spur of the
Mount of Olives, with the deep gorge of the Kidron on the
south, until Jerusalem suddenly burst into view. Thence descending
into the valley, Jesus entered the city and found his
way to the temple just as the sun was setting behind the western
hills. He sought not a waiting throne, but a place for quiet
worship. Then in the hush of the evening, refusing to give the
slightest encouragement to the selfish, material hopes of the
people, he returned to his humble home at Bethany.</p>

<p><b>Jesus' Activity in the Temple.</b> Jesus' activity during the
last week of his ministry gathers about the temple.<sup><a href="#z125">(125)</a></sup> The
remark of his disciples regarding its huge foundation stones
was used by him as a means of calling their attention to the
temple not built with hands. It was probably near the entrances
in the southern part of the great court of the Gentiles,
under the huge portico with its four rows of Corinthian columns,
that the extortionate money-changers and those who sold
doves plied their trade. To secure a place within the sacred precincts,
they must have bribed the temple officials. Jesus' act in
expelling them was, therefore, not merely a reassertion of the
sanctity of the temple, but also a rebuke of the corrupt practices
of the Sadducean nobles. Solomon's Porch, where Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
walked and taught, was the long colonnade with its double
row of pillars on the eastern side of the Court of the Gentiles.
From this eastern side one magnificent gate, with doors adorned
with Corinthian brass, led directly into the Court of the Women.
Within this small eastern court were probably placed the thirteen
offertory chests into which the people cast their free-will
offerings. Here only men and women of Jewish faith and parentage
were allowed to enter. It was probably within this court
that Jesus stood with his disciples and watched the people as
they cast in their offerings, the rich of their plenty and the poor
widow her mite.</p>

<p><b>The Last Supper and Agony.</b> The place of the upper
chamber, where Jesus ate the last supper with his disciples, is
not definitely known. Tradition fixes it at a certain place on
the western hill. Equally uncertain is the exact site of the Garden
of Gethsemane. Its name indicates that it was probably
an olive grove containing an oil press. It was doubtless enclosed
with a fence like similar gardens about Jerusalem to-day.
It was situated somewhere to the east of the Kidron, on the
side of the Mount of Olives. A tradition which is probably
not older than the sixteenth century identifies Gethsemane<sup><a href="#z126">(126)</a></sup>
with a garden low down in the Valley of the Kidron, opposite
the temple. This garden, with its eight old olive trees, aids
the imagination in picturing the spot, probably farther away
and more secluded, where Jesus met and overcame his last
great temptation, and gave himself wholly and voluntarily to
the completion of the divine task entrusted to him.</p>

<p><b>Scenes of the Trials.</b> The Gospel narrative implies that
Jesus was not tried before a formal meeting of the Sanhedrin,
which would have convened in one of the chambers immediately
adjoining the temple, but in the house of Caiaphas, the high
priest. This midnight session was, therefore, not a regular
trial, but a preliminary examination by his Sadducean enemies,
with a view to formulating definite charges against him. The
house of the high priest was undoubtedly near the temple, probably
somewhere to the west. According to the Fourth Gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the trial before Pilate, the Roman governor, was held in the
Prætorium. The judgment seat of Pilate may have been connected
with the palace reared by Herod on the western hill,
which was then the home of the Roman rulers of Jerusalem, but
more probably it was in the tower of Antonia, immediately
to the north of the temple, opening into the Court of the Gentiles
where the mob which was in league with the high priestly party
was assembled.</p>

<p><b>Traditional Place of the Crucifixion.</b> The exact scene of
the crucifixion is also uncertain. The biblical records indicate
that it was outside the city wall and yet in a conspicuous position
near the city and also near an important highway. In
the vicinity was a tomb, and the name, Golgotha, suggests that
it was either at a place of burial or else on a hill, the form of
which suggested the shape of a skull. In Luke the place is
called The Skull, supporting the conclusion that it was the
peculiar form of the rock that gave the place its name. Jerome
speaks of it as the little mountain, or hill, of Golgotha. It was
the practice both of the Jews and Romans to put to death public
offenders outside the city. In the case of those, like Jesus,
charged with rebellion, a conspicuous public place was chosen
in order to make the object-lesson more impressive. The traditional
site of the crucifixion is due west of the temple, across
the upper end of the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley. It is possible to infer
from recent excavations that it was just outside the northern
wall of the Roman city. Tombs discovered at this point show
that it was also a place of burial. While this identification is
not impossible, it cannot be traced farther back than the fourth
Christian century.</p>

<p><b>The More Probable Site.</b> A more probable site is somewhere
near the rounded skull-like hill five hundred feet north of
the Damascus gate, above the so-called Grotto of Jeremiah.<sup><a href="#z127">(127)</a></sup>
It is near the great northern road and, because of its height,
can readily be seen from the northern side of the city. It is
the continuation of the northern ridge on which Jerusalem is
built and its bold form and abrupt face are due to the rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
cuttings at this point. Vast quantities of stone used in the
repeated restorations of the walls have been taken from these
quarries. Probably Herod quarried at this point much of the
stone used in extending the temple area southward. The bold,
rocky bluff on the northern side of this quarry was well adapted
to public executions. If this was the scene of the crucifixion
the place where the cross rested has probably been cut away
by later excavations.</p>

<p><b>The Place of Burial.</b> In a little garden to the left is shown
to-day a well-preserved, rock-cut tomb.<sup><a href="#z128">(128)</a></sup> It is an excellent
example of the family tomb of the Roman period and may have
been that of Joseph of Arimathea, although there is no conclusive
evidence. It possesses great interest, however, because it is
a type of the tomb in which the body of the Master was laid.<sup><a href="#z129">(129)</a></sup>
Most significant is the fact that not one of the places which
witnessed the closing scenes of his life can be identified with
absolute assurance. Occidental as well as oriental Christianity
has shown itself too eager to worship sacred sites and in so
doing to forget the deeper meaning of the events which have
made the places memorable. Though most of the scenes will
remain forever unknown, the work and teachings of the Master
will abide and occupy an increasingly larger place in the life
and thought of mankind.</p>

<h3>THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY THROUGHOUT
THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h3>


<p><b>Original Centre at Jerusalem.</b> The spread of Christianity
throughout the civilized world bears conclusive testimony not
only to the life-giving truth of Jesus' message, but also to the
supreme wisdom of his method. His heroic death at first
daunted, but the vision of his living presence, which, according
to the oldest records, came to his disciples amidst the familiar
scenes on the northern shores of the Sea of Galilee, quickly inspired
them to take up the mission which he had left them and
to proclaim abroad the good tidings of God's love for men.
Strangely enough, Galilee, which had been the scene of the call,
the training, and the sending forth of Jesus' disciples, again sinks
into oblivion. Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida had failed
to respond to their great opportunity. In accordance with the
implied, if not the expressed, commands of Jesus, his disciples
soon transferred their homes and work to Jerusalem, the religious
home of the Jewish race, to which they, as well as their
Master, at first alone appealed. Here it was possible at the
great annual festivals, when the pilgrims streamed to the temple
from all parts of the Roman empire, to touch the entire
Jewish world. Following the example of the Great Teacher,
his disciples took up the task of teaching and preaching within
the precincts of the temple and especially at Solomon's Porch
on the eastern side, where he had often walked and talked.</p>

<p><b>Spread of Christianity Outside Judea.</b> The stoning of
Stephen, which was outside the city and probably in the deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
quarries immediately to the north of the temple, marked a new
epoch in the life of the early Christian community, for it was the
beginning of a bitter persecution at the hands of the Jewish
authorities, which soon drove the disciples in all directions
from secluded Judah and transformed them into a world-conquering
missionary force. In this early dispersion the apostles
naturally followed the great highways, which led northward,
southward, and westward from Jerusalem. Philip the Evangelist
preached with great success at Samaria. Here he was
building on an older Hebrew basis, for the Bible of the Samaritans
contained the first five books of the Old Testament with
portions of the book of Joshua. The mixed Samaritan population,
however, ever open by virtue of their geographical position
to the diverse influences that surged up and down the eastern
Mediterranean, never proved a stable element in the early
Christian church.</p>

<p><b>Philip's Work in the South and West.</b> Leaving the Samaritans,
Philip set out for the coast city of Gaza. He probably
took the central highway from Jerusalem southward by way of
Hebron. A late tradition places the spring where he baptized
the Ethiopian official on the tortuous road, practically impassable
for chariots, which leads southwestward from Jerusalem,
but the older and more probable tradition identifies it with
that beside the main road southward, a little north of Bethzur.
Thence Philip turned westward, preaching and teaching with
success at the old Philistine town of Ashdod, which lay three
miles from the Mediterranean, on the border line between the
fertile plain and the drifting sands, at the point where the main
coast highway divided into its eastern and western branches.</p>

<p><b>Extension and Expansion of Christianity During the
First Decade.</b> Peter, likewise, turned westward, and at the
flourishing city of Lydda, which stood where the main highway
from Jerusalem to Joppa crossed the great northern coast
road, found a well-established Christian community. Joppa<sup><a href="#z130">(130)</a></sup>
stood on a bold hill looking out over the western sea. It was
fitting that here Peter, the natural leader of the rapidly growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Christian church, should have a clear vision of the great
and needy Gentile world that lay beyond the narrow bounds of
Judea. Joppa was indeed the gateway between Jerusalem,
which represented Judaism, and Rome, which stood as the
embodiment of regnant heathenism. From Joppa, with its
small, rocky harbor, the apostle followed the messengers of
Cornelius, the Roman centurion, along the road which closely
skirted the shore to Cæsarea, the new door which Herod the
Great had opened between Palestine and the Gentile world
along the shores of the Mediterranean. Here Peter was far
beyond Jewish atmosphere and civilization. The population,
the public buildings, and the language of this busy seaport were
either Greek or Roman. Thus, before Herod Agrippa in 41
<small>A.D.</small> entered upon his brief but brilliant reign of three years,
Christianity had swept over the borders of Judea into the great
strategic cities of the western coast plains and even to Damascus,
far in the north. It was also breaking the narrow Jewish bonds
and following the great western highways that were guiding
it on to the conquest of the empire.</p>

<p><b>Situation and History of Tarsus.</b> The man who led this
forward movement and formulated the world-wide policy of the
Christian church was born in a city of southern Cilicia, which
stood midway between the east and the west. There the influences
of the ancient Orient and of the more active Occident met
and mingled. The city of Tarsus lay on a rich, moist, alluvial
plain, ten miles north of the Mediterranean and only eighty
feet above the level of the ocean. Two miles farther north rose
the foot-hills that led up to the lofty, massive peaks of the Taurus
Mountains. These northern heights shut off the cooling winds,
making the climate of Tarsus hot and enervating. In ancient
times the sluggish river Cydnus flowed through the centre of
the town on its way to the sea. The strength of Tarsus consisted
in its position at the southern end of the great Cilician
Plain. At this point the main highway from Antioch to Ephesus
and Smyrna touched the Cydnus and thence turned northward,
crossing the Taurus range by the famous Cilician Gates. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
commercial prestige, however, was not so much the result of its
natural position as of the energy of the early population. They
had drained the marshes about the Cydnus and transformed
the lake immediately south of the town into a large inland harbor.
They also cut the road beside the narrow stream that
penetrated the Taurus range, making Tarsus the seaport of the
wide plains to the north. Tarsus in the days of Paul was a
magnificent city of fully half a million population. Its citizens
were supremely proud of their city&mdash;a pride which the great
apostle to the Gentiles clearly shared. The energy which characterized
the inhabitants, as a result of their successful struggle
with adverse natural conditions, was also reflected in the character
and work of its most distinguished citizen.</p>

<p><b>Influence of His Early Home Upon Paul.</b> Probably from
the days of Antiochus Epiphanes, Tarsus had been the home
of a large and influential Jewish colony. They were doubtless
permitted, as an independent social and religious group, to
share in the citizenship of the proud Roman city. This Roman
citizenship not only delivered Paul at many crises in his
stormy career, but also brought him into intelligent and sympathetic
touch with the great empire to which he bore the
message of the cross. The atmosphere, therefore, of Paul's
early life was distinctly Roman and cosmopolitan. The influence
of this broad environment is traceable in all his work
and teachings. From the port of Tarsus ships ran frequently
to Cæsarea and Joppa, the ports of Jerusalem. Thus the
journey was easy and natural for the young Jew of Tarsus
as he went back to the sacred city of his race to study at the feet
of Gamaliel, the greatest Jewish scholar of the age. His life
in Palestine brought him into closest touch with the growing
Christian church. The energy which he had inherited from his
native city found expression at first in active persecution of the
members of the new sect. The open-mindedness which he
had acquired from his youthful environment, and which later
led him to appreciate that which was good in the heathen religions,
prepared the way for the supreme experience which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
came to him as he was crossing the desert on his way northward
to Damascus.<sup><a href="#z42">(42)</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Work at Antioch.</b> The history of the spread of Christianity
for the next decade is chiefly a record of the work of the
great apostle to the Gentiles. The graphic passages in the second
half of the book of Acts present a remarkably vivid picture
of his journeys and experiences. It was natural that Paul,
a native of Asia Minor, should not remain in the narrower
atmosphere of Palestine, but should find instead a congenial
environment and field of work in Antioch, the great and opulent
capital of Syria, the third metropolis of the Roman empire.
Here he was able to observe the impression which Christianity
made upon the heathen, and especially upon the Jews of the
dispersion. Antioch was also the natural geographical centre
from which to set out upon his missionary journeys.</p>

<p><b>Importance of the Pioneer Work of Paul.</b> In all his
missionary activity, Paul evidently followed a definite plan.
He selected as the scenes of his work the great cities, situated
on the main highways of communication and commerce. This
choice was in part due to the fact that in the larger cities of this
character were found Jewish communities, with synagogues
which opened doors of opportunity to the pupil of the famous
Rabbi Gamaliel. During the two preceding centuries the Jews
of the dispersion had become an exceedingly active proselyting
force. The influential and honorable position which they had
won in many of the Græco-Roman cities, as well as the character
of their faith, commended them to the most worthy of
their heathen neighbors. The result was that many of the
Gentiles had accepted the essentials of the Jewish religion and
worshipped with the Jews in their synagogues. This class is
ordinarily described in the narrative of Acts by the designation
"devout Greeks." Thus Judaism had prepared the way for
the spread of Christianity. From the ranks of the devout
Greeks was drawn a large proportion of the converts, who responded
to the early preaching of Paul and of the other Christian
apostles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span><b>Paul and Barnabas in Cyprus.</b> With these conditions in
mind, Paul and Barnabas planned their first missionary journey.
Cilicia belonged within Antioch's sphere of influence and was
indeed a part of the province of Syria. Paul and Barnabas
turned to the immediately adjacent island of Cyprus and the
Roman province of Galatia, lying respectively to the southwest
and northwest. Cyprus possibly attracted them because Barnabas
was a native of that island. Throughout all its history
it had stood in close commercial relations with Syria. Salamis,
its chief eastern city, was first visited. It lay at the mouth of
the River Pediæus on the eastern edge of a fertile plain which
extended far to the west. The Ptolemies, as early as 295 <small>B.C.</small>,
had transported many Jews to Cyprus, and Herod the Great
doubtless sent many more to work the copper mines there which
he controlled.</p>

<p><b>At Paphos.</b> From Salamis two Roman highways ran across
the island to Paphos, the chief city on its western shores. The
Roman city which Paul and Barnabas visited was the new
Paphos. It was situated on the sea-coast, being in fact the
seaport of the older inland city ten miles to the southwest.
The older city had been famous throughout the ancient world
as the seat of the corrupt worship of the Paphian goddess,
whom the Greeks identified with Aphrodite. At the new city
Paul came into contact both with the Roman ruler and a representative
of the local superstitions.</p>

<p><b>Journey to Antioch in Galatia.</b> From Paphos it was
easy to secure a passage northward to the coast of Pamphylia,
for along this course passed many of the merchant ships from
Alexandria to Rome. The apostles probably landed at Attalia
and thence went to Perga, the chief city of central Pamphylia.
It lay five miles from the river, on a plain at the foot of a bold,
extended acropolis. The climate of these low-lying coast plains
was sultry and malarial. The city was dominated by the
worship of a local goddess and there is no evidence that there
was a Jewish synagogue at this point. Because of these unfavorable
conditions, Paul and Barnabas simply passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
this southern city on their way to the great strategic centres
farther north. The journey thither through the deep valleys
and over the rough heights was exceedingly arduous. Here
Paul doubtless experienced many of those perils of rivers and
perils of robbers which he mentions in II Corinthians 11:26.</p>

<p><b>Conditions at Antioch.</b> It was at the Roman colony of
Antioch,<sup><a href="#z131">(131)</a></sup> that the apostles found their first great field of
activity in Asia Minor. The town lay about three thousand six
hundred feet above the level of the sea, on an isolated plateau
two miles in circumference, which rose from one to two hundred
feet above the western plain. On the east it was protected by
a rocky gorge through which flowed the River Anthios. The
city was, therefore, a natural fortress, able to resist the frequent
attacks of the warlike Pisidian mountaineers. It had been
made a Roman colony by Augustus a little before the beginning
of the Christian era and hence was an outpost of Rome itself
and dominated the southern part of the great Roman province
of Galatia. The worship of the local deity had recently been
abolished, so that the city offered an unusual field for missionary
work. The Jewish colony was apparently large and influential,
for many Gentiles joined with the Jews in worship
at their synagogue. From the first Paul and Barnabas appear
to have made a profound impression upon the people of this
important city. It was their success that aroused certain of the
Jews and the Roman magistrates of the city so that the apostles
were forcibly expelled.</p>

<p><b>At Iconium.</b> From Antioch they turned eastward, following
the Roman highway that led to Lystra. Instead, however,
of going at once to Lystra, they turned to Iconium,<sup><a href="#z132">(132)</a></sup> eighty
miles east of Antioch. This town lay on a level plain three
thousand three hundred and seventy feet above the sea. It
was protected on the west by a lofty mountain range, from
which emerged the river, which first irrigated and then lost itself
in the wide, thirsty plain on which Iconium lay. Unlike
Antioch, Iconium had no natural barriers. Great energy and
skill were required to utilize successfully the waters of its main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
stream and to protect it from the annual floods. Here grew up
a flourishing commercial city with an active, resourceful population.
A Jewish colony and a synagogue offered an excellent
field for the apostles' work. Here they remained for a long
time, preaching, teaching, and laying the foundations for the
strong Christian church which made Iconium long after an
important religious centre. In time, however, the opposition
of the Jews crystallized and the apostles were driven forth by
a mob.</p>

<p><b>At Lystra and Derbe.</b> From Iconium they turned southward
to Lystra,<sup><a href="#z133">(133)</a></sup> twenty miles distant. It was a quiet town,
situated in a pleasant valley in the midst of which rose a bold,
elongated hill about one hundred and fifty feet high, which was
the acropolis. The valley was watered by two streams which
flowed from the western hills. While it was a Roman colony
and connected with Galatian Antioch, it was aside from the
great highways of commerce. The apostles evidently turned
to it as a refuge. Antioch and Iconium were strong Græco-Roman
towns, but at Lystra Paul and Barnabas came into contact
with the native Lycaonian population. The readiness with
which the natives identified the energetic spokesman, Paul,
with Hermes, and the more reserved and dignified Barnabas with
Zeus, reveals the naïveté of the small provincial town. Again
the attack of a mob, incited by Jews who came from Antioch
and Iconium, compelled the apostles to seek refuge in Derbe,
on the southeastern end of the Lycaonian plain. The town
was probably situated on a low hill that stands in the midst of
the great plain about forty-five miles south of Iconium.<sup><a href="#z134">(134)</a></sup> On
the south the lofty range of the Taurus shuts it off from the sea.
Here the apostles were among the native people, with little
Roman, Greek, or Jewish influence to interfere with their work,
which appears to have been successful and undisturbed by persecution.
From this point they retraced their steps through all
the cities where they had recently labored. Thence going southward
they stopped for a short time at Perga and then sailed
from Attalia back to Antioch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span><b>Decision of the Great Council at Jerusalem.</b> The successful
work of the apostles, extending probably through two
years, raised a great controversy in the church as to whether the
Jewish institution of circumcision was necessary for salvation.
Paul and Barnabas journeyed southward through Ph&oelig;nicia and
Samaria, telling the Christians on the way of the results of their
work among the heathen. Fortunately the church met this great
crisis wisely and in the spirit of Jesus. The narrow Jewish
bonds were broken and Christianity went forth comparatively
untrammelled on its world conquest.</p>

<p><b>Work of Paul and Silas in Asia Minor.</b> Paul and Barnabas,
accompanied by Judas and Silas, two representatives of the
church at Jerusalem, devoted themselves for a time to the work
at Antioch, the Syrian capital. They soon, however, felt the
call to the larger field beyond. Barnabas, accompanied by
Mark, returned to Cyprus, and Paul, taking Silas, set out on
his second great missionary journey. His object was twofold;
first to visit and encourage the churches already established, and
second, to carry the message of the Gospel to Ephesus, the great
commercial, political, and religious centre of western Asia Minor.
They first visited the churches of Syria and of the sub-province
of Cilicia. Thence they followed the great military road westward,
stopping at Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, and probably Antioch.</p>

<p><b>Paul's Vision at Troas.</b> Being prevented from entering
the northern province of Bithynia, Paul and Silas went on
through Mysia to Troas, on the extreme western boundary of
Asia Minor. While at this seaport town, which stood at the
end of the great overland route from Asia,<sup><a href="#z135">(135)</a></sup> facing the
Ægean and the continent of Europe beyond, a vision came to
Paul which marked a new stage in the expansion of Christianity.
The experience was remarkably similar to that which came to
Peter at the port of Joppa. In response to this vision, Paul
left behind his work in Asia Minor and took ship for Neapolis,
the port of Philippi in Macedonia. In so doing he was following
the most direct highways between Asia Minor and Rome
(<i>cf.</i> p. 82).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span><b>Paul and Silas at Philippi.</b> The city of Philippi lay about
nine miles northwest of its seaport, Neapolis. It was on the
southern side of a great plain that extended to the north and
northwest. Its chief river flowed along its eastern side into a
huge marsh that flanked the city on the south. Like many
of the cities chosen by Paul as the scenes of his labors, it was a
Roman colony. It was probably chosen because of its strategic
value as one of the outposts of the great empire whose conquest
for Christ was already the goal of Paul's endeavor. Also, as
the event proved, Rome's protection was of great value to the
apostle, who could claim citizenship in the imperial city. Apparently
there was only a small Jewish colony at this point and
no synagogue, so that Paul established connection with his
countrymen at the open place of prayer beside the river and
beyond the city walls. The success of their work aroused the
inevitable opposition and led to their imprisonment; but on
this occasion they were sent forth from the city at the request
of the magistrates rather than by force.</p>

<p><b>At Thessalonica.</b> From Philippi they proceeded westward
along the well-travelled Egnatian Way to Thessalonica, the
capital and chief commercial city of Macedonia. It lay at the
northeastern end of the Thermaic Gulf, the present Gulf of
Salonica, in a great ampitheatre formed by the surrounding
hills, which were crowned by a strong citadel. Vast plains lay
behind the city and it commanded the trade of the northern
Ægean. Because of its loyalty to the cause of Octavius and
Antony it had been made a free city, ruled by its own assembly
and magistrates, called Politarchs. Here, as at Philippi, Paul
succeeded in laying the foundations of a strong Christian church,
composed largely of the Greek converts to Judaism. The hostile
Jews soon charged Paul and Silas with stirring up sedition and
rebellion, a charge to which the rulers of a free city like Thessalonica
were especially ready to listen. Much to his regret, Paul
was therefore obliged suddenly to leave the city.</p>

<p><b>Paul at Ber&oelig;a.</b> As in his flight from Iconium, he now found
refuge at a quiet, retired town. Ber&oelig;a lay fifty miles southwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of Thessalonica, in the midst of groves of trees and flowing
streams. It was flanked by a bold mountain range on the
west and faced toward the Ægean, with a broad expanse of plain
lying in the foreground. Here Paul found a nobler type of
Jews, probably untouched by the mercenary spirit of those who
had been attracted to the great commercial centres like Thessalonica
and Philippi. His work among both the Jews and Greeks
was very successful until emissaries came from Thessalonica.
Paul's heart was evidently set upon returning to take up his
work at the Macedonian metropolis, but events had proved
that this was impossible.</p>

<p><b>At Athens.</b> Accompanied by the Christians of Ber&oelig;a, Paul
next went southward along the Ægean to the home of that civilization
which had surrounded him in his boyhood days at
Tarsus and profoundly influenced the fields in which he had
done his work. Landing at the port of Piræus, he proceeded
along the new road to Athens, beside which stood the altars to
the unknown gods. On entering the city he naturally went to
the Agora, on the south of which Mars Hill<sup><a href="#z136">(136)</a></sup> rose abruptly.
East of this was the Acropolis, crowned by that most peerless
product of Greek art, the Parthenon. Athens was still at the
height of its artistic splendor, but it had already ceased to be
the political and intellectual capital of the Greek world. Superficial
philosophy and sophistry had taken the place of real
intellectual leadership. Athens, being aside from the world's
commerce, had little attraction for the Jewish colonists. The
city, therefore, lacked the religious background which Paul
had found helpful in all his previous work. The critical, speculative
atmosphere of the city was uncongenial. Paul was accustomed
to addressing himself to the vital, crying needs of
humanity. He made a strong effort to adapt himself to the new
conditions, not without some success, but there is no record of
a church at Athens, and he soon left to find a more promising
field.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Corinth.</b> Corinth, to which Paul next went,
marks an important epoch in his ministry. The city was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
by the ancients the "Bridge of the Sea."<sup><a href="#z137">(137)</a></sup> It lay on the narrow
neck of land which connected the Corinthian with the Saronic
Gulf. It was on one of the three great highways from the
east to the west, and here all cargoes had to be trans-shipped.
It was also the bridge that connected the Peloponnesus with
northern Greece. By nature, therefore, it was destined to become
a great and influential city. It was built on a broad terrace
at the end of a gently sloping plain, with an almost impregnable
acropolis rising one thousand eight hundred feet above
the sea-level. When Paul visited the city it was the metropolis
and Roman capital of the province of Achaia. From the days
of Julius Cæsar it had been a Roman colony. Because of its
commercial importance its population was cosmopolitan, including
many Jews. Like most cities thus situated, it was exceedingly
prosperous and profligate.</p>

<p><b>Paul's Work at Corinth.</b> To this needy and important
field Paul addressed himself with superlative devotion. Anxious
regarding the results of his work in Thessalonica, harassed by
poverty and weakened by sickness, he nevertheless devoted
himself to teaching both Jews and Gentiles, at the same time
plying his trade as a tent-maker. Finding the Jews hostile, he
devoted his time almost entirely to the Gentiles, making his
home with Titus Justus, whose name suggests Roman origin.
Unable to visit the church at Thessalonica, Paul wrote to the
Christian community there the two letters known as I and II
Thessalonians. At about the same time he appears to have
written his famous epistle to the Galatian churches. These
letters mark the beginning of that remarkable correspondence
which is recorded in the epistles of the New Testament. During
this period or at a later visit Paul wrote from Corinth the
letter known as the Epistle to the Romans, which contains the
fullest and noblest résumé of his doctrines. Corinth was one
of the few places which Paul was not compelled to leave under
pressure of persecution. After a sojourn of about two years he
departed for Syria, stopping for a short time at Ephesus, and
finally landing at Cæsarea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span><b>His Third Journey.</b> After visiting the churches at Jerusalem
and Antioch, Paul set out, probably early in the spring,
on this third great missionary tour. As in his second journey,
his aim was to visit the churches which he had established and
to proclaim the Gospel in the city of Ephesus. He first revisited
the region of Galatia and Phrygia, and thence, following
westward the great caravan route, he apparently went on directly
to Ephesus by the higher and more northern road. Ephesus,
for the next year or two, became the head-quarters from
which he made journeys to the churches in Macedonia and
Achaia. Apparently at certain points, as for example at Illyria
on the Adriatic, he extended still farther the sphere of his influence.</p>

<p><b>Situation and Importance of Ephesus.</b> Ephesus was at
this time the chief commercial city of eastern Asia Minor.
Here converged the great highways from the east and north.
The town lay opposite the island of Samos, on the bank of the
Cayster River. Like most Greek cities, it was built on and
about an imposing hill and was enclosed by a great wall.
It was a characteristic Roman city, with a huge theatre,<sup><a href="#z138">(138)</a></sup>
a beautiful agora, a stadium seating over six thousand, a forum,
and streets lined with colonnades; but its dominant life and
ideas were Greek. This western culture was deeply influenced by
that of the Orient, for Ephesus, by virtue of its position, was pre-eminently
the place where the East and West met and blended.
The population of the city was as cosmopolitan as its civilization.
Here also Roman, Greek, Alexandrian, and oriental thought
met and mingled. Next to Delphi, its temple was the most
important religious force in the Greek world, but its influence,
on the whole, was immoral and debasing. Here, in the face of
active persecution, Paul and the Christian workers whom he
gathered about him established what later proved to be the
most influential church in Asia Minor. Paul did not leave the
Ægean until he had established a Christian community at Troas,
which he had visited on his second journey, and at the important
cities of Colossæ and Laodicea, east of Ephesus, on the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
caravan road from Syria and the Tigris-Euphrates Valley. The
latter churches appear to have been established by his co-workers,
for in his letter to the Colossians Paul implies that he had never
personally visited their city.</p>

<p><b>Return to Palestine.</b> Having planted the Christian faith in
all the great strategic centres along the main thoroughfares which
led to Rome, Paul set out by boat from Miletus<sup><a href="#z139">(139)</a></sup> to return
to Jerusalem. Following the usual course along the southern
shore of Asia Minor, he landed at Tyre. Thence he went by land
to Jerusalem, stopping at Ptolemais and Cæsarea. The bitter
persecution which he experienced at the Jewish capital and his
long, wearisome confinement at Cæsarea are familiar chapters in
the life of the apostle.<sup><a href="#z115">(115)</a></sup> They only intensified his oft-expressed
desire to visit the capital of the great empire, whose strength and
weakness he fully appreciated. Again his Roman citizenship
enabled him to escape his persistent persecutors and to reach
Rome, although as a prisoner.</p>

<p><b>Journey to Rome.</b> In this last long journey his courage
and faith, as well as his wide experience as a traveller, were
dramatically illustrated. Sailing from Cæsarea, he, with his Roman
guard, trans-shipped at Myra, a city of southern Lycia, on
an Alexandrian merchant ship. Thence the usual sea route
was followed along the southern shore of Crete until the storm
drove them south of their course, past Sicily, to the island of
Melita, the modern Malta. There the ship was wrecked and
they were obliged to remain through the winter. Then by another
Alexandrian merchantman they sailed northward, landing
at Puteoli, and thence proceeded by land to Rome along the
Appian Way.<sup><a href="#z140">(140)</a></sup> At last at this goal of all his missionary
journeying, Paul was able to extend widely the bounds of the
church, already established in the capital, and through the
medium of letters and messengers keep in close touch with the
churches which he had founded.</p>

<p><b>The World-wide Conquests of Christianity.</b> Whether or
not Paul was able later to visit distant Spain, as certain early
church traditions assert, cannot be definitely determined. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
least it is certain that the goal which he had set before himself
had been, in one sense, fully attained. Within less than thirty
years after the death of Jesus, active, growing Christian communities
were to be found in all of the important cities of the eastern
and northern Mediterranean. Two or three centuries later
heathenism was vanquished and Christianity was master of
the empire. This marvellous achievement would have been impossible
if Rome, in the course of its natural development, had
not broken down all national and racial barriers and bound
together the peoples of that ancient world into one great empire.
It had opened and developed the natural highways, making
communication comparatively quick and easy. The natural
trend of civilization was also from the east to the west, and
Christianity moved on the crest of a great wave which was
sweeping over the western world. Thus the faith of the Hebrew
prophets and of Jesus, first proclaimed among the hilltops
of Judea and Galilee, was able to enter upon that world-wide
conquest which is the most significant fact in human history.</p>

<h3>STEREOGRAPHS AND STEREOPTICON SLIDES ILLUSTRATING
"BIBLICAL HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY"</h3>


<p>The following stereographs (or stereopticon slides) have been prepared
to illustrate the physical characteristics of the biblical world
and the most important events of biblical history. Inquiries in regard
to prices, methods of ordering, and other details should be sent directly
to Underwood and Underwood, 3 West 19th Street, New York
City or to Underwood and Underwood, 104 High Holborn, London,
W. C., England. Through them a supplemental booklet (with three
locating maps) may also be secured, that gives detailed descriptions of
each of the views. Sixty of the most important, that may be used
repeatedly to illustrate different subjects and events, have been starred.</p>
